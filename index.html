    This web version of our lab notebook was created by David Boyd.
    It was created from a scanned PDF of the notebook.
    The notebook had been rained on, and all its pages disordered.
    Much of the PDF-to-docx conversion resulted in transcription errors from the character recognition software. 
    And there were a lot of preexisting typos and grammatical mistakes - not all scientists are great at grammar!
    As de facto editor-in-chief, I went hard in the paint on the grammatical corrections at first. But then I left in some minor errors made by original authors as a tribute to those who came before us.
    The formatting is not all consistent. This is a result of the combination of a large volume of content with a limited time budget.
    If you're reading this, good on you. 
    Sometimes web developers hide easter eggs in the comments.

            <h4>Determining pH with Fisher Acument Model 23A pH/Ion Meter </h4><br>

            Temperature should be set on 25 Â°C. Function should be set on pH.<br>
            Refill electrode with pH electrode filling solution as needed to keep it filled up to the hole.<br><br>
            
            
            <strong>Calibration</strong><br><br>
            
            1.	Remove electrode from storing solution. Slide plastic tubing down to uncover hole on electrode.<br>
            2.	Rinse electrode with distilled water and blot dry with Kim-wipe. Never touch the tip of the electrode. It is very thin and will easily break.<br>
            3.	Store electrode temporarily in distilled water if it will be more than about 5 seconds between readings. Always blot electrode before placing it into standard reference solution. <br>
            4.	Place electrode into beaker of pH 4 reference solution.<br>
            5. Move switch from "standby" to ''use".<br>
            6.	If meter does not read 4.0, use standardize knob to set it on 4.0.<br>
            7.	Move switch to pH Ref. between readings.<br>
            8.	Rinse electrode with distilled water and blot dry.<br>
            9.	Place electrode into beaker of pH 7 reference solution.<br>
            10.	If meter does not read 7.0, use standardize knob to set on 7.0.<br>
            11.	Check standards to see that they now read 4.0 and 7.0. If not, repeat steps 4-10. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Reading samples</strong><br><br>

            1.	Weigh 20 g soil into cup or beaker.<br>
            2.	Add 20 ml distilled water to cup.<br>
            3.	Stir with glass stir rod.<br>
            4.	Let sit 30 minutes.<br>
            5. Stir again and read pH. Make sure solution covers the dot about W' from the tip of the electrode.<br>
            6.	Rinse electrode between readings.<br>
            7.	After all readings are completed, return switch to "STBY" for storage.<br>
            8.	Place electrode into storage solution.<br>
            9.	Slide plastic tubing up to cover the hole.<br>

    <div class="col col-12 page" id="media-sterilization">
        <h4>Media sterilization</h4>
        <p>Colonies happily reproduce when fungal spores or bacteria-laden microscopic particles make contact with your plates, broths, and tubes; and your precious media will eventually resemble something out of an abandoned full refrigerator. One can't recognize individual colonies when the plates are covered with fuzz! No untreated surface in the lab is sterile, and nearly all dust and other particles have spores or active cells on their surfaces. All labware and all media must be sterilized before use. We sterilize most media and supplies using a steam autoclave that produces moist heat. Other methods, including filtration, ethylene oxide, radiation, or ultraviolet light may be necessary if components are heat-liable or materials are not heat resistant.</p>

        <p> An autoclave is designed to deliver steam into a pressure chamber, generating high heat and pressure at the same time. Heating media to above 121 degrees C for a minimum of 20 min. should destroy all living cells and spores. High pressure (typically 20 lbs/sq in) allows the temperature to exceed 100 degrees without boiling off the water from the solutions being sterilized. We use an autoclave that starts timing when the temperature reaches 121 degrees, and exhausts the steam slowly after the prescribed time above 121 degrees (to prevent exploding bottles!). The autoclave is effectively a giant pressure cooker.</p><br>

        To properly use an autoclave:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Know the instrument - some are fully automatic, some are fully manual</li>
            <li>Prepare supplies properly - the more layers or greater the volume, the longer it will take for the interior to heat up</li>
            <li> Check the steam pressure and ensure that the instrument is set for slow exhaust if liquids are to be sterilized</li>
            <li>Ensure that the door is closed properly and securely</li>
            <li>Check that the time and/or automatic cycle are set properly</li>
            <li>Ensure that the temperature is well below 100 degrees before attempting to open the door</li>
            <li>Crack the door to allow steam to vent, keeping face and hands well away from the opening</li>
            <li><strong><em>CAUTION!</em></strong> Exposing tightly stoppered bottles to variable pressures invites explosion and injury. When heating any liquids using any method, take care disturbing the flask or bottle. Material near the bottom may be superheated and boil over when moved. Stoppers, caps, covers, must be vented - never make them fit tightly.</li>
        </ul>

        
        
        
        <h4>Aseptic technique</h4>
        <p>The media on which you culture desirable microorganisms will readily grow undesirable contaminants; especially molds, other types of fungus, and bacteria from your skin and hair. It is therefore essential that you protect your cultures from contamination from airborne spores and living microorganisms, surface contaminants that may be on your instruments, and from skin contact.</p>

        <p>Bacteria and other contaminants cannot fly. Nearly all forms of contamination are carried on microscopic dust particles that make their way onto sterile surfaces when they are carelessly handled. One exception is insect contamination, such as by ants or fruit flies. Fruit flies are a particular nuisance because they can crawl under the lids of agar plates and lay eggs. You would think that people doing genetics research would have developed a model by now that can't fly into other peoples' experiments!</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Never leave a culture dish open, even for a short time when viewing colonies of organisms, unless you intend to destroy it</li>
            <li>When it is necessary to open a dish, keep the lid close to the dish, open it only as far and as long as is necessary to accomplish the procedure, and keep the lid between your face (and your germs!) and the agar surface.</li>
            <li>For most bacterial cultures you will use a sterile loop or needle to inoculate or to obtain an inoculum.</li>
            <li>Flame a loop or needle to red-hot just prior to use, burning off any organic material</li>
            <li>Cool the instrument by touching the sterile agar or liquid surface prior to touching a culture (or else you will kill it)</li>
            <li>Re-sterilize the instrument after performing the procedure, putting down safely without burning the bench, you, or another student</li>
            <li>Pass the neck of a culture tube or any container with a culture or sterile contents through a flame before taking off the cap. Hold the cap with opening down, and the tube horizontal or nearly so. Convection from the heated neck will prevent dust from falling into the opening. Flame again before putting the cap back <small>(see <a href="#smear">'preparing a bacterial smear'</a>)</small></li>
            <li>Use sterile disposable pipets to remove samples from a broth culture that must be kept uncontaminated.</li>
            <li>Always be aware of where your hands are,where your face is, and whether or not your culture is in a position to be contaminated. If you have long hair, make sure it does not hang into your plate. Hair is full of potential contaminants, and is one of the principle sources of contaminant microorganisms.</li>
            <li>If you have an open flame, long hair that is not tied back or loose clothing can be hazardous to your health.</li>
            <li>Keep flammables away from the flames, including alcohol used for sterilizing instruments. Do not place a heated loop or glass rod into an alcohol dish.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>A contaminated culture can often be rescued; however, there is always the risk that you will reÂ­isolate the wrong microorganism. Besides, you don't have that kind of time to waste. Exercise extreme care to keep your cultures pure.</p>

                2.	Add dissolved agar to 1500 ml of distilled water in one of the bowls or pots. Put on hot plate and use stir bar to keep mixture stirred while heating until mixture turns clear.<br>
                3.	Repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 with second bowl or pot.<br>
                4.	Put 4 soybean stems into each jar.<br>
                5. Pour about 200 ml agar into each jar.<br>
                6.	Wipe rims of jars.<br>
                7.	Put lids onjars and cover lids with aluminum foil.<br>
                8.	Autoclave for 25 minutes.<br>
                9.	Transport autoclaved jars on cart lined with paper towels wet down with 10% chlorine.<br>
                10.	When jars are cool enough to handle, use pipette to dispense 0.2 ml lactic acid into eachjar without uncovering tops of jars' (leave foil above top of jar).<br>
                11.	When agar is cool, it is ready to be inoculated.<br><br>

            <h4>Maintenance of Inoculum</h4>

            <p>
                Isolates are maintained on half strength of PDA. This agar is prepared by adding O.1 g of Streptomycin and 0.1 g of neomycin per liter when agar has cooled down to 55Â°F. Inoculated plates are incubated in the dark at 24Â°C for two to three weeks.<br>
                
                Inoculum increase<br>
                The fungus is increased on 100 g of sorghum seeds that are soaked overnight in 250 ml flasks. Next morning drain extra water, cover, and autoclave. Wait 24 hours and autoclave again. When cooled, inoculate flask with 5-7 plugs (8mm diameter) of actively growing fungal mycelium and incubate at 24Â°C in dark for two weeks.<br>
                
                
                Inoculations<br>
                Seedbed inoculations: A mixture of steam-treated field soil, sand, and ProMix (1:1:1) is used for greenhouse assay. One to two infested sorghum seeds are planted with each soybean seed. Water lightly and keep under 14 h day light with 70-75Â°F day and 60Â°F night temperatures. Maintain the soil near water holding capacity. Seedlings were scored three weeks after emergence.<br>
                
                Seedling inoculation: Germinate seeds in ProMix or sand in 'cel-paks.' Remove 12-14 day old seedlings from the sand or ProMix and wash thoroughly, being careful to avoid any root injury. Transfer to 3-5 in. diameter plastic pots containing soil-sand-ProMix mixture (1:1:1). 5-8 Fsg infested sorghum seeds are placed next to the taproot of each seedling and roots are covered with same soil mix. Pots are kept under 14 h day light with 70-75Â°F day and 60Â°F night temperatures. Fertilize bimonthly with a dilute (1/4 strength) of an all-purpose greenhouse liquid fertilizer. Seedlings started scoring after the appearance of first visible foliar symptoms. Seedlings can be kept up to 60 days in the greenhouse.<br>

        <h4>Sorghum Seed Inoculation</h4>
            1.	Fill a plastic garbage can with tap water and 15 bags of sorghum seed** (each bag is ~70 lbs, therefore ~105 lbs of seed is needed). Soak for 12 hours or overnight.<br>
            o	Remove any floating debris accumulated In garbage can after soaking.<br>

            o	Fill almost to the top with soaked sorghum seed.<br>
            o	Run tap water from the hose over the sorghumseed until the water comes out clear (not brown) from the bottom of the container.<br>
            o	Letthe seed drain for 5 minutes.<br>
            3.	Weigh 8 lbs of drained sorghum seed in a clear plastic autoclave bag on a scale (i.e. Include weight of bag on scale).<br>
            o	Tip: A 1000 ml plastic beaker filled 4 times equals approximately 8 lbs.<br>
            o		Remove air from bag; place a foam plug in neck of bag and tie a string around outside of bagto secure foam plug while continually pushing air out.<br>
            4.	Autoclave bag for 1 hour on "liquids" setting at 121Â°C. <br>
            o	Store on floor to cool overnight. <br>
            5.	The following day, autoclave bag again for 1 hour on "liquids" setting at 121Â°C. Â°
            o	Let bag cool. <br>
            6.	Inoculate autoclaved sorghum seed: <br>
            o	Under the hood, inoculate sorghum seed with 8Sg of SOS lnoculum from a flask that has grownfor 10 days (or 2 weeks - see inoculum increase protocol above). <br>
            o	Store Inoculated bag at 70Â°F.<br>
            o	Let the inoculum grow for a few days, then shake bag each day to break up and distribute inoculum. <br>
            **Heather will decide between 1 g/ft (i.e. 4800 g) o 2 g/ft (I.e. 9600 g) of inoculated seed used for planting; will need to prepare enough for 11 lbs of sorghum only!

            <h4>SIUC Method of SDS Scoring</h4>
            <p>
                <h6>Considerations for Obtaining Meaningful Field SDS Ratings</h6>
                
                Site Selection:<br>
                To obtain valid comparisons among varieties in a field test, it is essential to have reasonable uniform disease pressure. Therefore, we choose fields with a history of severe SDS occurring uniformly throughout the field in several previous seasons. In addition, we require a SDS test plot to be level or very gently sloped, and to have a uniform soil type. In order to maintain our preferred com-soybean rotation, we scout potential fields at peak SOS expression two years before we want to use them. We have found it important to scout fields ourselves, for what is "bad SDS throughout the field" to a farmer may be woefully variable for a variety test.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Experimental Design:<br>
                Reducing Spatial Variability<br>
                Because SDS symptom development so strongly depends on the interaction of weather conditions with the stage of plant development, we conduct a separate trial for each one-half maturity group when it is practical. This benefit is two-fold. It allows for better com11arisons within maturity groups and it keeps trials physically small thus reducing spatial variability.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Planting<br>
                Since early planting dates have proven to be conducive to disease development, trials are planted as early as possible. Most trials involve 2-row, 10 ft. plots. We consider two rows sufficient since our experience has failed to identify any border effects.<br>
                When possible, the land is prepared by no-till practices. If post-emergence weed control is needed, we generally use spot spraying, cultivation and/or hand weeding. To eliminate interference with SOS ratings we rigorously avoid herbicides that cause any soybean leaf damage past the V4 stage.
                Irrigated locations offer the greatest guarantee of SDS symptoms. However, keep in mind that during a drought year, even irrigation will have a difficult time mimicking natural rainfall.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rating Leaf Symptoms<br>
                Disease symptoms are rated as close as possible to the R6 stage (at which seeds have just reached full size), but before the earliest maturing entries have started to senesce. This is when leaf symptom expression is most developed. When other leaf diseases are prominent, it is sometimes necessary to rate earlier than R6 to avoid masking of SOS by the other diseases. RÂ­ stages are pictured on the following page.<br>
                Disease incidence (DI) is the percentage of plants in the plot with leaf symptoms.<br>
                Disease severity (DS) is pictured on the following page. It is recorded on a I to 9 scale with increments of 0.5.<br>
                Disease index (DX) is calculated as DI x DS/9, and has a range of 0 (no disease) to 100 (all plants dead before R6).

                Determining R-stage: All descriptions apply to at least one pod at any of the four uppermost nodes. Other pads at these same nodes may not be fully developed. Stages are determined by seed and pod development on the main stem. By R5.O, the leaf at the terminal node is normally fully developed, so the phrase "with a fully developed leaf" was omitted from the description of the four uppermost nodes.

            2)	In 8 to 10 days, plants need be thinned out to yield 4 plants per pot. Plants should then be fertilized with Osmocote. <br>
            3)	Within 2 weeks of planti ng, plants need be staked with 12"wooden skewers to keep them from becoming entangled.<br>
            Growing the pathogen and inoculum preparation<br>
            4)	<em>Cercospora sojina</em> (or other relevant pathogens) must be cultured on the same day the plants are planted (step 1). Four plates are usually sufficient to make enough conidial suspension to inoculate 12 soybeans at the V4 growth stay, but you should culture 6 plates just in case of culture contamination or lack of sporulation. Culture the isolate(s) on fresh Y8 media. Wrap in parafilm and incubate in complete darkness at 24Â°C for about 3 weeks to allow for conidia production.<br>
            5)	After 3 weeks, harvest conidia by flooding the plates with approxi mately 15 ml of a 0.05% Tween 80 solution per plate.<br>
            a.	Protocol for preparing the Tween 80 stock solution:  In a 1 L beaker. mix 500 mL of sterile deionized water and 1.5 mL of Tween 80. Stir on a magnetic stirrer until the Tween 80 is completely dissolved . It may take some time, but the Tween 80 will go into solution. This stock solution (0.3%) may be stored for some time in the flammables cabinet. Check the stock solution before each use.  If it is cloudy or shows signs of preci pitation, make a new solution before use. <br>
            b.	To prepare  the 0.05% Tween  80 solution: Use the formula C1V 1= C2V2 to make 500 ml of the 0.05% Tween 80 from the 0.3% stock Tween 80 solution (see Sa). This is achieved by taking 83 ml of 0.3% Tween 80 and combining with 417ml of sterile deionized water. <br>
            6)  The surface of each fungal colony should be scraped using a sterile wooden coffee stirrer, or other similar device, and then the suspension needs to be filtered through four layers of sterile cheesecloth. <br>
            7)	The concentration of conidia in the filtrate should be measured using a hemocytometer and 1O Î¼L of the suspension. Adjust to the required concentrations by further diluting it with 0.05% Tween 80 solution. We typically use a final concentration of 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> spores/ml to inoculate the plants in the greenhouse. <br>
            a.	Directions   for hemocytometer   usage: Determining the concentration  of spores  in suspension using a hemocytom eter requires that you count spores in certain squares based  on your total counts, dilution  factor. initial  volume, and desired  final  density. The central  square of the hemocytometer  (encircled  in red) has grids of different sizes. Take care that that you  know the grid size and height  (read  the instruction  manual), otherwise you'll  make  calculation  errors.   Use the central square (reference the bottom  left image), which  is divided  into 25 smaller squares, such that the squares highlighted  in blue are additionally  subdivided into  16 smaller squares (see middle image below)  and these blue squares are the ones within which you will  count the individual  cells; however  the size of your spores and  the density of your suspension  will influence which square-size within which you will need to count. For example, if your spores are small and high in concentration count within the smallest or 'red' squares (as displayed in part 7b); otherwise count within the 'yellow' or 'blue' squares. Do not count cells on the top and right lines (sec bottom right image).<br>

        b. The volume of a small square is specific to the hemocytometer. It is calculated by multiplying the width by the length (which are the same - usually  1mm each) by the depth (usually 0.1mm) of a small square.<br>

        d. With the measured cell density obtained, then you can calculate how much more diluent you need in order to reach the final desired cell density.

        e. You will need to subtract the volume you solved for in part 7d  from the final volume in order to create the dilution. <br>

        <h6><em>Diluent volume to add = Desired final volume - Volume of initial cell suspension you added</em></h6>>

        8)	For soybean plants at growth stage V4, a total volume of 2.5 ml of inoculum suspension is enough to inoculate a single plant.<br>

        9)	Directly following inoculation, plants must be incubated in a dew chamber at 24Â°C for 24 hours. After that the plants should be moved to a plastic chamber to maintain high relative humidity until symptoms appear.<br>

        10) Check the plants for symptoms daily 5 days post-inoculation. Timing may vary depending on isolates used and ambient conditions.<br>

        <h4>Protocol for preservation of isolates: Filter paper</h4>
        1.  Cut a Whatman #1 filter paper into small triangle pieces and put them ina small glass beaker for autoclaving.<br>
        2.	In a second glass beaker, put in small coin envelopes.<br>
        3.	Autoclave both containers at 121Â°C (15 psi) for at least 20 minutes.<br>
        4.	Prepare media of choice in the typical manner. For Cercospora sojina we recommend full-strength PDA.<br>
        5.	If preserving new isolates, monoconidial cultures are required (See single spore isolation protocol). These cultures should be 2-3 weeks old prior to attempting the preservation protocol.<br>
        6.	Do this under a laminar flow hood. Use sterile forceps to deposit the previously sterilized filter paper directly onto your agar of choice. Ifyour agar was poured into large petri plates, you can place about 3-4 filter paper triangles (depending on the size of your filter paper) on the agar. Do not overlap the filter papers. Ifusing small petri dishes, use 1-2 filter papers.<br>
        7.	From the mycelial culture you wish to preserve, take a plug or cut out a small piece of mycelium and deposit onto the center of the agar plate containing the filter paper(s). The fungal fragment does not need to be directly upon the filter paper. Seal plate with parafilm or place in a crisper box under lab conditions.<br>
        8.	Repeat step 7 for all isolates as many times as desired.<br>
        9.	Allow the cultures to colonize the filter paper (3-4 weeks). Then, under the laminar flow hood, lift the paper from the agar using sterile forceps and place in the previously sterilized coin envelopes. Filter papers from the same plate can be placed in the same envelope. Different isolates deserve different envelopes. Make sure to label envelopes appropriately (sample origin, date of isolation, date stored). Leave the filter papers in the coin envelopes in the hood to dry overnight.<br>
        10.	Place the coin envelopes in a closed plastic container lined with silica gel sorbent, and stored at -20Â°C until required.<br>
        11.	To grow out the filter paper specimen, cut small pieces of the paper using sterile forceps (under laminar flow hood) by holding the base of the paper inside the envelope and pulling the opposite site with the forceps. Plate the small filter piece(s) covered with fungal mycelium ina fresh PDA medium.<br>
        12.	Place the plates in a crisper box (or wrap in parafilm) and incubate under lab conditions.<br>
        13.	To increase conidia production, transfer the culture to V8 plates and incubate in complete darkness at 24-25Â°C. Ifsporulation is not of interest, plates can be left on the benchtop under typical lab conditions.<br>

                <li>Place leaf sample with the underside facing up under a dissectingscope</li>
                <li>Use a 10 or 20 ul pipette to deposit a small volume (10-20ul) of sterile deionized water onto a single FLS lesion.While viewingthe lesion under the microscope,pipette the water droplet up and down to dislodge the conidia.

                <li>Filter the spore suspension through a few layers of cheesecloth to remove mycelial fragments from the suspension.</li>
                <li>

        <h4>Characterization of azoxystrobin sensitivity using media-coated glass slides</h4>

        <p><strong>Stock solutions</strong><br> 
            First, it is necessary to make stock solutions of both azoxystrobin and SHAM. To make a concentration of 100 mg/ml (100,000 Âµg/ml), weigh out 0.104 g of technical grade azoxystrobin (96% a.i) and dilute in 1 ml of acetone.</p>

        <p>Using the formula CIVI = C2V2, make 10-fold dilutions by taking 100 ÂµI of the first concentration and mixing in 900 ÂµI of acetone (10 mg/ml). In total, make S stock solutions: 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 Âµg/ml.</p>

        <p>For SHAM, make only one stock solution of 60 mg/ml by weighting 0.06 g of SHAM and diluting in 1mlof methanol. Vortex vigorously until completely dissolved. Place in 55Â°C water bath for a few minutes if having trouble dissolving.</p>

        <p>In both cases, the final concentration of both solvents: acetone and methanol in the media should be 0.1% (voYvol). Therefore, diluting 60 Âµl of each stock solution in 60 ml of media, the final concentration of the solvents will be 0.1%.</p>

        <p>Note: Both SHAM and Azoxystrobin are light-sensitive so keep out of light as much as possible. Wrap stocks inaluminum foil.</p>

        <p>Fungicide sensitivity. The media-coated glass slides use microscopic slides covered with full strength PDA. For each isolate-fungicide concentration, three replicate slides should be used.</p>

        <p>
            1.	Weight 2.34 g of PDA (Becton Dickinson: BD) and fill with 60 ml of water, using small Erlenmeyer beaker (Â± 200 ml of capacity), for each fungicide concentration. In total use 6 fungicide concentrations (included unamended fungicide).<br>
            2.	Autoclave at 121Â°C (1S psi) for 15 to 20 minutes.<br>
            3.	Cool media using water bath until 50-55Â°C.<br>
            4.	In a laminar flow hood, add 60 Âµl of each fungicide concentration plus 60 Âµl of SHAM solution per each media. The stock solutions and the final fungicide concentrations obtained are:<br>

        <h4 id="negative-stain">Negative Stain</h4>

        <p>Negative staining is an excellent way to determine an organism's cellular morphology. Since the cells themselves are not stained, their morphology is not distorted in any way. The nigrosin provides a dark background against which the shapes of the unstained cells are clearly visible. This method provides a high degree of contrast not available in most other staining procedures.</p>
        

        <ol>
            <li>Place a single drop of nigrosin on a clean microscope slide, adjacent to the frosted edge.</li>
            <li>Using a flamed loop and sterile technique, remove some organism from your tu be or plate and mix it into the drop of nigrosin. Be sure there are no large clumps of organism, but try to avoid spreading the drop.</li>
    
            <li>Place the end of another clean microscope slide at an angle to the end of the slide containing the organism and spread the drop out into a film. This is done by contacting the drop of nigrosin with the clean microscope slide and using the capillary action of the dye/microscope slide to spread the nigrosin across the smear:</li>

            <h4>Identifying bacteria </h4> 
            
            A...Prepare a suspension of each unknown at @ 10^8 cfu/ml in a labeled test tube containing 4 ml of sterile tap. Samples can be compared to a spectrophotometer standardized bacterial suspension (OD 0.3 at 600nm) which will be provided. Be sure to maintain culture purity during preparation of the suspensions.<br>
            
            B...Use a micropipette and sterile pipet tips to transfer 25 ÂµL of each suspension onto media (3 strains/plate) listed below and subsequently use a flame-sterilized and cooled inoculating loop to spread the suspensions over the surface of the media. Be careful not to cross-contaminate the 3 cultures (use different tips for each culture and re-flame the inoculating loop between samples).	<br>
            
            Media(page number in lab guide) - incubate all plates at 28Â°C, except growth at 37Â°C test, and check at days 2-7 after plating:<br>
            
            YDC (4) -observe plates for bacteria color and production of diffusible pigments<br>
            
            KMB (4) -observe plates under long-wave UV light for production of diffusible fluorescent pigments	<br>
            
            NA+7% NaCl (3) -observe plates for bacterial growth (high salt tolerance) <br>

            DIM (9)-observe plates for bacterial growth (utilization of cellobiose)<br>

            Levan (93 -observe plates for white mucoid, dome-shaped growth indicating levan production from sucrose <br>
            
            TTC (154) -observe plates for bacterial growth and color on tetrazolium chloride<br>
            
            Arginine/Betaine (145) -observe plates for bacterial growth indicating use of Arginine and/or Betaine as carbon source, compare with Ã¸ plates containing no carbohydrate <br>
            
            Growth on D-Sorbitol (96,Ayer's basal medium) -observe plates for bacterial growth and color change of media, compare with Ã¸ Ayer's plate containing no carbohydrate <br>
            
            Hugh and Leifson (9) -observe plates for bacterial growth and media color change to yellow indicating oxidative metabolism of glucose <br>
                
            NA+copper (3) -observe plates for bacterial growth indicating copper resistance at 200 ppm <br>
            
            Growth at 37Â°C YNA (179) -observe plates for .bacterial growth at 37Â°C <br>

            C...Use a flame-sterilized straight inoculating wire to stab inoculate each bacterium into a test tube containing 4 ml of Hugh and Leifson medium (9) and cover the media with 1 ml of sterile mineral oil using a sterile pipet tip. Incubate the tube at 28Â°C and observe for a color change to yellow indicating fermentative metabolism of glucose.
 
            D...Use a flame-sterilized inoculating loop to patch (spot) inoculate (@about the size of a dime) each bacterium onto plates of starch medium (144) and lactose medium (3- ketolactose,24) and incubate the plates at 28Â°C for 2 days.

            After 2 days, pipet @ 500 Âµl of Lugol's Iodine solution onto the surface of the starch plate and observe the plate for clear, colorless zones sound bacteria indicating starch hydrolysis (iodine will stain the starch blue in the surrounding background area).

            After 2 days, pipet @ 500 Âµl of Benedict's reagent onto the surface of the lactose plate and observe the plate for a yellow ring of Cu2O around bacteria indicating the presence of 3-ketolactose (reaction takes @30-60 minutes to develop)

            E..Test bacteria for Gram reaction (7) by mixing a loopful of bacterial growth into 1-2 drops of 3% KOH on a microscope slide. Gram-negative bacteria will become gummy and will produce strings (due to cell lysis and release of DNA) upon mixing, GramÂ­ positive bacteria will not.

            F...Use a hypodermic syringe and needle to infiltrate the bacterial suspensions produced in step A of the procedure into the mesophyll of leaves of tobacco and pepper. Label the inoculated leaves and incubate the plants at 28Â°C in the growth room. Check the plants at 24h, 48h, and 5 days after inoculation to observe HR and additional inoculation phenotypes.

            <h4>How to do Gram Stains</h4>

            <h6>List of Reagents and Instruments </h6>
            Equipment: <br>            
            Bunsen burner, alcohol-cleaned microscope slide, water<br>
            
            Reagents:
            Crystal violet, Gram's iodine solution, acetone/ethanol (50:50 v:v), 0.1% basic fuchsin solution
            
            <h6>Procedures</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare a Slide Smear:</li>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Transfer a drop of the suspended culture to be examined on a slide with an inoculation loop. If the culture is to be taken from a Petri dish or a slant culture tube, first add a drop or a few loopfuls of water on the slide and aseptically transfer a minute amount of a colony from the Petri dish. Note that only a very small amount of culture is needed; a visual detection of the culture on an inoculation loop already indicates that too much is taken.<br>
                        
                        If staining a clinical specimen, smear a very thin layer onto the slide using a wooden stick. If at all possible, do not use a cotton swab; because the cotton fibers may appear as artefacts. The smear should be thin enough to dry completely Â·within a few seconds. Stain does not penetrate thickly applied specimens, making interpretation very difficult.
                    </li>
                    
                   <li>Spread the culture with an inoculation loop to an even, thin film over a circle of 1.5 cm in diameter, approximately the size of a dime. Thus, a typical slide can simultaneously accommodate 3 to 4 small smears if more than one culture is to be examined.</li>
                   <li>Air-dry the culture and fix it or over a gentle flame while moving the slide in a circular fashion to avoid localized overheating. The applied heat helps the cell adhere to the glass slide and make possible the subsequent rinsing of the smear without a significant loss of the culture. Heat can also be applied to facilitate drying the smear. However, ring patterns can form if heating is not uniform, e.g. taking the slide in and out of the flame.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <li>Gram Staining:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add crystal violet stain over the fixed culture. Let stand for 10 to 60 seconds; for thinly prepared slides, it is usually acceptable to pour the stain on and off immediately. Pour off the stain and gently rinse the excess stain with a stream of water from a faucet or a plastic water bottle. Note that the objective of this step is to wash off the stain, not the fixed culture.</li>
                    
                   <li>Add the iodine solution on the smear, enough to cover the fixed culture. Let stand for 10 to 60 seconds. Pour off the iodine solution and rinse the slide with running water. Shake off the excess water from the surface.</li>
                    <li>Add a few drops of decolorizer so the solution trickles down the slide. Rinse it off with water after 5 seconds. The exact time to stop is when the solvent is no longer colored as it flows over the slide. Further delay will cause excess decolorization in the gram-positive cell, and the purpose of staining will be defeated.</li>
                    
                   <li>Counterstain with basic fuchsin solution for 40 to 60 seconds. Wash off the solution with water. Blot with bibulous paper to remove the excess water. Alternatively, the slide may be shaken to remove most of the water and air-dried.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <li>Quality control:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a simple matter to prepare a control slide by breaking a clean wooden applicator stick and picking a small amount of material from the interproximal space of one's teeth. This should be smeared into a drop of clean tap water on a clean glass slide. The slide may be stained as above. This material will consistently display a few neutrophils and a mixture of Gram (+) and (-) organisms. Neutrophil nuclei should be pink.</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                <li>Examine the finished slide under a microscope.</li>
               <ul> 
                   <li>
                       A caveat in the examination of the Gram smears is the distortion in morphology that can be caused by antimicrobial therapy. This is especially likely to occur in urine speciments. Filamentous and pleomorphic forms may be observed among the Gram (-) rod species. Gram reaction of the organism may also change after antimicrobial therapy, Gram (+) bacterial may become gram variable. Look at areas that are one cell thick only; observation of thick areas will give variable and often incorrect results. White blood cells and macrophages should stain Gram-negative, whereas squamous epithelial cells are Gram-positive.</li>
                </ul>

                Preparing Samples<br><br>
                
                <p>Soil samples are prepared for counting (quantification of nematode numbers) in three steps, but these steps will vary depending on what kind of analysis we are doing. Numbers in parentheses refer to procedures described on the following pages.</p>
                
                 â¢	Processing, or extracting nematodes from the soil, involves sample screening and set-up (I).<br>
                â¢	Running the samples through the elutriator and transferring samples from sieves to tubes (IIA for egg samples, IIB for verm samples).<br>
                â¢	Getting the sample ready to count, means either grinding and staining egg samples (IIIA) or spinning verm samples in the centrifuge (IIIB).<br>
                
                <p>The final step is counting the number of SCN eggs per sample (or determining the number and kind of vermiform nematodes in the sample, which is done by Pat.)</p>
                
                We use the following equipment:<br>
                â¢	screen (hardware cloth) to break up  and mix soil.<br>
                â¢	Dishpan or suitable container to catch soil<br>
                â¢	elutriator a machine that floats nematodes out of soil and onto sieves, a small (5") 20 mesh sieve and an 8" 60 mesh sieve to catch cysts while separating out trash<br>
                â¢	a large (8") 400 mesh sieve to catch vermiform nematodes<br>
                â¢	hose and water bottles and funnels to remove samples from sieves<br>
                â¢	sets of beakers to hold samples while awaiting further processing<br>
                â¢	a stopper attached to a drill bit and inserted in a drill press to grind cyst samples and release eggs<br>
                â¢	a 60 mesh screen mounted in a pvc pipe<br>
                â¢	a container of clean water to clean the rubber stopper between samples<br>
                â¢	a small (6") 200 mesh sieve over a small 500Â·mesh sieve to separate eggs from cyst fragments<br>
                â¢	sets of 150 mL beakers to hold egg samples<br>
                â¢	acid fuschin stain for egg samples<br>
                â¢	microwave to heat egg samples for staining<br>
                â¢	nematode counting slides, disposable pipets, and microscopes to count eggs<br>
                â¢	centrifuge for cleaning up verm samples by concentrating the nematodes in the soil followed by floating the nematode in a sugar solution to separate them from the soil<br>
                â¢	sugar solution for verms: made by dissolving 454 grams (1 pound) sugar in 1 liter of water<br>
                â¢	a small 500 mesh sieve to separate verms from the sugar solution
                â¢	lab markers, china markers, towels, scrub brushes and other miscellaneous items<br><br>

                    I.	Sample screening and set-up:
                        This process is essentially the same for both egg and verm samples (with differences as noted).
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Prepare labels corresponding to sample bag identification. Metal strips will work for verms but plastic pot labels can be used for egg samples.</li>
                        <li>Put on disposable gloves to protect your hands. Open each sample bag, put a screen on top of a dishpan, and push the soil sample through the screen.   Mix the screened soil thoroughly.</li>
                        <li>Fill one pint containers with screened soil and keep label with the soil sample.</li>
                        <li>Remove all soil particles from the screen and the dishpan (use a brush and towel or whatever it takes) and your hands, otherwise you could contaminate the next sample. Water on the screens attracts dirt or makes mud. If a screen needs washing, wash it and switch to screening soil with another screen.</li>
                        <li>Start the process again with the next sample (and the next, and the next, and.....).  (Note that the samples are run through the elutriator process in sets of four.) When you are done, clean the dishpan and screen (use soap if necessary), and wipe down the sink drain boards.  Sweep up any soil that has fallen on the floor.</li>

                    II.	Running the samples through the elutriator and transferring samples from sieves to tubes (plus a few words on shutting down the elutriator and cleaning up the lab.)
        
                    <ol>
                        <li>Turning on the elutriator:<br>
                        -Turn on the water and attach the air hose to the elutriator.<br>
                        -Plug in power cord on elutriator. The front funnels should be in the upright position and sieves set (with the 60 mesh level in the metal funnel support on the collection funnels before you add any soil to the back funnels. Put the 8"-60 mesh sieve on the holder below the separators. Collect liquid from 3 of the 15 tygon tubes.<br>
                        -If you are running verms, add the verm holder and tum the motor on (this shakes the verm sieves automatically.<br>
                        -When the elutriator finishes rinsing and filling the funnels, it's ready to go.<br></li>
                        <li>Make sure the elutriator is clean! (It should already be clean, but..) If necessary, rinse the ledge where you put beakers, the tops and insides of the funnels, and sponge off the side shelves.</li>
                        <li>At this point, you will need to use different procedures depending on whether you are running egg or verm samples.  (If you are running verm + egg samples, you will need to combine the two procedures.) These procedures are described in the next two sections: IIA. Egg samples processing and IIB. Verm sample processing.</li>
                    </ol>
    
        
                    At the end of each processing session, you will need to shut down the elutriator and clean up:<br><br>
        
                    1. Shutting off the elutriator:<br>
                    -Let the elutriator run through its final dump cycle after you are done processing.  Then pull out the Dump button, wait until the front funnels come down, rinse the machine thoroughly, and turn the power off.  Turn off the motor if you have been running verms.<br>
                    -Turn off the water and air.<br><br>
        
                    2. Cleaning up:<br>
                    -Clean the ledges, funnels, funnel rims, and side shelves of the elutriator.<br>
                    -Wipe down the sink drain boards.<br>
                    -Sweep the floor if you think there is a chance that there is soil on the floor.<br>
                    -There should be no sign of soil sitting open to the air on any surface in the room.<br>
                    -spray down the metal inside surfaces of the elutriator with shower spray to reduce mineral buildup and mildew<br><br>

                <section>
                    IIA. Egg sample processing<br><br>
        
                    <ol>
                        <li>Rinse all the 20 mesh and 60 mesh sieves before using them.  Put a 20 mesh sieve on top of the small funnels in the front of the elutriator to collect debris. Put the sample label in the corresponding funnel.  Put the 60 mesh sieve below the sample separators.</li>
                        <li>Line up your first four samples in correct order on the back of the elutriator.  Push the start button, then place each sample into its corresponding large funnel.   (Note: do not put the sample into the large funnel before you turn on the elutriator. It will go straight down the drain! The sample will also be lost if the bottom plug does not close off the bottom of the funnel.)</li>
                        <li>Watch the sieves so that a sample is not lost when the 60 mesh sieve clogs with fine soil particles and overflows losing part of the sample.  When the water stops running in the elutriator (approximately 4 minutes) remove the 20 mesh sieves, transfer the label to an empty beaker. Take the 60 mesh sieves containing the SCN cysts and rinse the contents of each sieve into the appropriate beaker corresponding to the sample processed.  Then go back, carefully rinse the 20 mesh sieves into the base of the elutriator, and pull out Dump button.  When the funnels tip, rinse out the insides of the funnels and the bowls carefully. Then push Dump button back in.</li>
                        <li>Repeat this step until the contents of all four 60 mesh sieves have been transferred to the beakers.  Then rinse all the sieves carefully.</li>
                        <li>Put the 20 mesh sieves on the receiving funnels, the 60 mesh sieve below the separators and prepare to run another batch of samples.  Place the beakers on trays and put in the refrigerator for cyst counts if needed. When all samples have been transferred to the beakers and cysts have been counted, you are ready to grind and stain (see IIIA).  If you do not have time to do this, leave the beakers in the refrigerator with a note specifying the sample set number (date) and the words âNOT GROUND.â If you have made a mistake, write a note. âmixed sample ### with sample ###. Make a note on the dry erase board that these samples need to be redone. Another common mistake is putting the sieves on in the wrong order and dumping the cysts down the drain.</li>

                    IIB. Verm sample processing.
        
                    <ol>
                        <li>Before running verm samples through the elutriator, the three tygon tubes leading from the lowermost receiving funnel to the verm sieves must be cleaned.  Use soapy water and a long thin bottle brush.  These tubes need to be cleaned at least once every day that you run verms.  After finishing, pour the rest of the soapy water in the funnels.  Then dump the funnels and rinse thoroughly.</li>
                        <li>Label a set of centrifuge tubes with the sample set number (date).  You will also need a water bottle and the small funnel for sample transferring.</li>
                        <li>Start as for egg samples: Rinse all the sieves carefully (in case someone did not rinse them well after using them the last time). Put a 20 mesh sieve over a 60 mesh sieve on top of the small funnels in the front of the elutriator. (This is if you are doing E &amp; V. If you are only running verms then replace the 20 mesh sieve with a 10 mesh sieve to catch the bigger verms.) Tilt the top (either 10 or 20 mesh) sieve towards the spout so it collects water. Put the large 400 mesh sieves in the holder.  Tum on the motor if you haven't already done this (this will automatically shake the sieves). You will not see the shaking of the sieves until you start the elutriator. You still need to carefully watch all screens. The 400 mesh sieve is the most likely to overflow and ruin the sample extraction.</li>
                        <li>Line up your first four samples in correct order on the back of the elutriator.  Push the start button, then put each sample into its corresponding large funnel.  (Note: do not pour the sample into the large funnel before you turn on the elutriator-it will go straight down!)</li>
                        <li>Watch the large sieves while the elutriator is running to make sure they do not overflow.  If they start to get full, either turn_ them, tap the sides of the sieves, or spray a little warm water in them.  When the water stops running in the elutriator, if you are running E &amp; V, the 60 mesh sieve should be processed as described for egg samples.  See below if you are running just verms. Concentrate the soil along one edge of the 400 mesh sieve with the large sprayer hose (gentle spray so you do not blast the nematodes into aerosols), and transfer it to the appropriate centrifuge tube using a wash bottle and the small funnel. Then repeat until the soil collected on each of the four large sieves is in the corresponding centrifuge tube.  Rinse the large sieves carefully and set aside. Fingernails ruin the screens. Hold all screens so that you touch the metal holders but not the screens themselves. Some screens are several hundred dollars.  Set aside screens that have holes in them as they need to be fixed temporarily and new screens ordered to avoid sample loss or contamination.</li>
                        <li>If you are running samples for venn determination only, rinse the contents collected on the 1O mesh sieves into the bottom of the elutriator, wash the contents of the 60 mesh sieve into the 400 mesh sieve, wash the contents on the 400 mesh sieve into a centrifuge tube as described above. Rinse the funnels tip, rinse out the insides of the funnels and the bowls carefully.  Then push the Dump button back in. Then proceed with rinsing the sieves and dumping as described above.</li>
                        <li>When all the samples have been elutriated, sieved and collected in centrifuge tubes, you are ready to spin the venns (see IIIB).  If you do not have time to do this, leave the tray of centrifuge tubes in the refrigerator with a note specifying the sample set number (date) and the words NOT SPUN.</li>

                    Egg Preparation IIIA Grinding and Sieving:
                    <p>The egg samples in the beakers contain cysts and the eggs. The cyst walls need to be broken open so we can count the eggs.</p>
        
                    <p>Clean the rubber stopper by running the drill press for 15 seconds using a beaker of clean water. Change the rinse water periodically. The timer is set by moving the hinged hand to the time desired. The timer will tum off at the end of the time. Attach the white collection bucket with the bungie cord if the collection bucket with the drain tube is not in place.</p>
        
                    <p>Take the first beaker and pour the contents of the tube into the pvc tube with the 60 mesh sieve piece. Wet down and then stack a 200 mesh over a 500 mesh sieve and place them under the pvc pipe before starting to grind.</p>
        
                    <p>Grind the sample for 30 seconds adding water either with the sink hose or with a water bottle. The stopper heats up from the friction if liberal amounts of water are not present. Set the timer! When the sample is ground, rinse the stopper with water into the 200 mesh sieve. Gently rinse the sieve to move any attached eggs onto the 500 mesh sieve.</p>
        
                    <p>
                        To make egg counting easier we remove the cyst wall fragments by collecting the fragments on a 200 mesh sieve which allows the eggs to pass through and be caught on the 500 mesh sieve.
                        Discard the cyst wall remains contained on the 200 mesh sieve. The contents of the 500 mesh sieve need to be concentrated in a portion of the edge of the sieve and rinsed into a 150 ml beaker.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        Continue grinding and sieving the rest of the set. Staining:
                        Take the beakers containing the eggs. There should be 20 to 40 ml of liquid containing the eggs in the beakers. Add 1.5 ml acid fucshin egg stain to each beaker. If there is a lot of organic matter in the beakers (dark and dirty looking water) add 2 ml to the beaker. Note: check automatic pipet for correct volume. Put 4 beakers at a time in the microwave oven and heat to just boiling. This depends on the amount of liquid in the beakers but will take about 2 minutes for 4 beakers. The heat sets the stain in the eggs. Proceed with the staining until all beakers containing liquid have been processed. Put the set of beakers in the refrigerator until ready to count.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>Stain recipe - 1:3 ratio of lactic acid to water, 0.035 g acid fucshin/100 ml of liquid. The fans should be turned off before weighing the acid fucshin to prevent stain dust covering unwanted areas.</p>

                    IIIB -Spinning Verms
        
                    <p>This step separates the vermiform nematodes from the soil and organic matter making it easier to determine which nematodes are present. It requires running the centrifuge in two steps. Take the venns in the centrifuge tubes into the room with the centrifuge. The centrifuge will hold 16 samples at a time. The centrifuge needs to be balanced. This means that the volume of water in tubes opposite of each other should be equal. If this is not done, it will not only damage the centrifuge but could cause the centrifuge to bounce off the table destroying people and property. Once the centrifuge is loaded (a water blank is used for odd number of samples) set the dial to 5 minutes. There is a hatch mark on the dial for rpm (7.5) and that should not be adjusted. This run will concentrate the nematodes and soil into the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Soon after the centrifuge stops spinning (Do not open the lid of the centrifuge if it is still spinning.) remove the tubes and decant the liquid into the sink. While the centrifuge is on the first spin remove the sugar solution contained in the wash bottle from the refrigerator. Add sugar solution (227 g table sugar/500 ml water) to the centrifuge tubes. Use a spatula and mix the soil from the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Rinse the spatula into the tube just stirred. Avoid contaminating samples. Load the centrifuge making sure the load is balanced. Set the timer for 5 minutes again. While the centrifuge is running, rinse the 500 mesh sieve. Decant the liquid from a centrifuge tube onto the 500 mesh sieve. This size will collect the vermiform nematodes. Rinse the sieve carefully with water. Clean out the centrifuge tube so that no soil remains in the bottom of the tube. Rinse the contents on the 500 mesh sieve into the cleaned centrifuge tube. Continue this process until all the verm samples are cleaned up. Place the rack in the refrigerator for Pat.</p>

            </section>



            Counting Eggs:

            <p>Take the set of beakers to be counted out of the refrigerator. Add clean water until there is 40 ml of liquid in the beaker to be counted. (If there is already more than 40 ml of liquid in the beaker, dilute the sample to 60 ml and make the appropriate math corrections.) Stir the contents of the beaker with a disposable pipet until the solution is frothy. Withdraw liquid from the suspension using the disposable pipet. Place the liquid in the cavity of the counting slide. The cavity contains 1 ml. Set up the magnification on the microscope such that you can see either the upper and lower lines of one cell starting in the upper left-hand comer of the counting slide. Alternatively you can use less magnification and view 2 cells within the field of view. Move the slide from left to right and then snake down until all cells are counted. Record on the mechanical counter eggs as you view them. Reminder: not all objects stained red in the viewing field are eggs. Eggs are kidney-shaped with smooth edges. Eggshells are empty but retain the general shape of eggs but a slit or only part of the eggshell remains. Count eggs and egg shells. Do not count verms (worm shaped nematodes). Sometimes you will encounter juveniles emerging from eggs and view a verm partially within an egg. Count this as an egg. After the slide has been counted, rinse the contents of the slide into a beaker for disposal with a wash bottle unless told to save the sample. Write down the number of eggs recovered in the sample in the appropriate sample line. The egg count should be converted to 1 pint of soil. Multiply the egg count by 40 for the appropriate amount of liquid in the beaker (here is where you correct for the volume of liquid in the beaker), and multiple by 5 to correct for sampling only from 3 of the 15 tubes. Correct for soil volume if running less than 1 pint.</p>

            <p>At the end of the egg counting session clean the slide with the pipe cleaner. Clean up the counting area when done and leave it ready for the next person to count.</p>

                <li>Make sure the timer in the box on the side of the elutriator is set to the desired running time.</li>
                <li>Turn on the power switch on the opposite corner of the elutriator and use the spray nozzle to clean the machine thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Press the "dump"button and wait for the bowls to fill with water.</li>
                <li>Clean all the sieves thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Place samples to be elutriated on tray behind the large funnels.</li>
                <li>Place size 60 sieves on top of the small funnels and insert tag from each corresponding sample</li>
                <li>Place size 20 sieves on top of the 60 sieves</li>
                <li>Press black button on opposite side of elutriator from power switch to start the machine 1I . Dump samples into corresponding large funnels</li>

            <span>When samples are finished running:</span>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove size 20 sieves and rinse clean with spray nozzle</li>
                <li>Rinse contents of size 60 sieve into medium sized beaker</li>
                <li>Swirl contents of the beaker so that any cysts float to the surface</li>
                <li>Pour cysts off the top of the water into the flip top collection tube</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 twice more to collect a total of 100-150 ml of cyst solution</li>
                <li>Clean sieves thoroughly</li>
            </ol>
            <span>Turn off and unplug the Elutriator. Turn valve on water line to "off'' position when finished.</span>

        <h4>Counting Reniform Nematodes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Process	cup of soil through the elutriator.</li>
            <li>Catch all the soil.</li>
            <li>Set the 60 mesh sieve on top of the 400 mesh sieve and place on the top rack of the elutriator.</li>
            <li>Be sure to backwash the 400 mesh sieve to dislodge the nematodes before rinsing residue into jars which are numbered to match the soil sample number.</li>
            <li>Have sugar solution at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Process samples according to Procedures for Processing Nematode Samples, steps 10 through step 14.</li>
            <li>Counting dishes should be numbered to match the sample number.</li>
            <li>Mount the counting dish to a slide (use double-sided tape) and place slide on Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope.</li>
            <li>Count only the reniform nematodes inthe 26 colored squares (5% of the 530 squares).</li>
        </ol>
        <span>We use 1/4 pt. of soil and count 5% of area of counting dish, so we must multiply our results by 80 in order to get reniform #/pint.</spa>
