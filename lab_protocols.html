            Temperature should be set on 25 °C. Function should be set on pH.<br>
            Refill electrode with pH electrode filling solution as needed to keep it filled up to the hole.<br><br>
            
            
            <strong>Calibration</strong><br><br>
            
            1.	Remove electrode from storing solution. Slide plastic tubing down to uncover hole on electrode.<br>
            2.	Rinse electrode with distilled water and blot dry with Kim-wipe. Never touch the tip of the electrode. It is very thin and will easily break.<br>
            3.	Store electrode temporarily in distilled water if it will be more than about 5 seconds between readings. Always blot electrode before placing it into standard reference solution. <br>
            4.	Place electrode into beaker of pH 4 reference solution.<br>
            5. Move switch from "standby" to ''use".<br>
            6.	If meter does not read 4.0, use standardize knob to set it on 4.0.<br>
            7.	Move switch to pH Ref. between readings.<br>
            8.	Rinse electrode with distilled water and blot dry.<br>
            9.	Place electrode into beaker of pH 7 reference solution.<br>
            10.	If meter does not read 7.0, use standardize knob to set on 7.0.<br>
            11.	Check standards to see that they now read 4.0 and 7.0. If not, repeat steps 4-10. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Reading samples</strong><br><br>

            1.	Weigh 20 g soil into cup or beaker.<br>
            2.	Add 20 ml distilled water to cup.<br>
            3.	Stir with glass stir rod.<br>
            4.	Let sit 30 minutes.<br>
            5. Stir again and read pH. Make sure solution covers the dot about W' from the tip of the electrode.<br>
            6.	Rinse electrode between readings.<br>
            7.	After all readings are completed, return switch to "STBY" for storage.<br>
            8.	Place electrode into storage solution.<br>
            9.	Slide plastic tubing up to cover the hole.<br>

        <div id="media-sterilization">
                <h5>Media sterilization</h5>
                When ftmgal spores or bacteria-laden microscopic particles make contact with your plates, broths,and tubes colonies happily reproduce and your precious media eventually resemble something out of an abandoned full refrigerator. One can't recognize individual colonies when the platesare covered with fuzzf No tmtreated surface in the lab is sterile.and nearly all dust and other particles have spores or active cells on their surfaces. Obviously, then, all labware and all media must be sterilized before use. We sterilize most media and supplies using a steam
                autoclave to produce moist heat. Other methods, including filtration, ethylene oxide,radiation, or ultraviolet light, may be necessary if components are heat-labile or materials are not heat­ resistant.
                
                An autoclave is designed to deliver steam into a pressure chamber, generating high heat and pressure at the same time. Heating media to above 121 degrees C for a minimum of 20 min. should destroy all living cells and spores.. High pressure (typically 20 lbs/sq. in) allows the temperature to exceed 100 degrees without boiling off the water from the solutions being sterilized. We use an autoclave that starts timing when the temperature reaches 121 degrees, and exhausts the steam slowly after the prescribed time above 121 degrees (to prevent exploding bottles!).The autoclave is effectively	giant pressure cooker.
                
                To properly use an autoclave
                •	Know the instrument - some are fully automatic, some are fully manual
                •	Prepare supplies properly - the more layers or greater the volume, the longer it will take
                for the interior to heat up
                •	Check the steam pressure and ensure that the instrument is set for slow exhaust if liquids
                are to be sterilized
                •	Ensure that the door is closed properly and securely
                •	Check that the time and/or automatic cycle are set properly
                •	Ensure that the temperature is well below 100 degrees before attempting to open the door
                •	Crack the door to allow.steam to vent, keeping face and hands well away from the opening
                •	***CAUTION*** Exposing tightly stoppered bottles to variable pressures invites
                explosion and injury. When heating any liquids using any method, take care disturbing the flask or bottle.Material near the bottom may be superheated and boil over when moved. Stoppers, caps, covers, must be vented - never make them fit tightly.
                
                
                
                <h5>Aseptic technique</h5>
                The media on which you culture desirable microorganisms will readily grow undesirable contaminants especially molds and other types of fungus, and bacteria from your skin and hair.<br>
                It is therefore' essential that you protect your cultures from contamination from airborne spores and living microorganisms, surface contaminants that may be on your insbuments, and from skin                contact<br>
                
                
                
                
                
                
                Bacteria and other contaminants cannot fly. Nearly all fonns of contamination are carried on microscopic dust particles that make their way onto sterile surfaces when they are carelessly handled. One exception is insect contamination, such as by ants for fruit flies.Fruit flies are a particular nuisance because they can crawl under the lids of agar plates and lay eggs.You would think that people doing gentics research would have developed a model by now that can't fly into other peoples' experiements!<br>
                
                •	Never ]eave a culture dish open, even for a short time when viewing colonies of organisms, unless you intend to destroy it<br>
                •	When it is necessary to open a dish, keep the lid close to the dish, open it only as far and as long as is necessary to accomplish the procedure, and keep the lid between your face
                {and your germs!) and the agar surface.<br>
                •	For most bacterial cultures you will use a sterile loop or needle to inoculate or to obtain an inoculum.<br>
                •	Flame a loop or needle to red-hot just prior to use, burning off any organic material
                •	Cool the instrument by touching the sterile agar or liquid surface prior to touching a
                culture (or else you will kill it)	·
                •	Re-sterilize the instrument after performing the procedure, putting down safely without burning the bench, you, or another student
                •	Pass the neck of a culture tube or any container with a culture or sterile contents through a flame before taking off the cap. Hold the cap with opening down, and the tube horizontal or nearly so. Convection from the heated neck will prevent dust from falling into 1heopening.Flame again before putting the cap back [see 'preparing a bacterial smear' inthe staining section]
                •	Use sterile disposable pipets to remove samples from a broth culture that.must be kept uncontaminated.
                •	Always be aware of where your hands are,where your face is, and whether or not your culture isin aposition to be contaminated. Ifyou have long hair, make sure it does not
                hang into your plate.Hair is full of potential contaminants, and is one of the principle
                sources of contaminating microorganisms.
                •	Ifyou have an open.flame, long hair that is not tied back or loose clothing can be hazardous to your health.
                •	Keep flammables away from the flames, including alcohol used for sterilizing instruments; do not place a heated loop or glass rod into an alcohol dish
                
                A contaminated culture can often be rescued, however there is always the risk that you will re­ isolate the wrong microorganism. Besides, you don't have that kind of time to waste. Exercise extreme care.to keep your cultures pure.
