    This web version of our lab notebook was created by David Boyd.
    It was created from a scanned PDF of the notebook.
    The notebook had been rained on, and all its pages disordered.
    Much of the PDF-to-docx conversion resulted in transcription errors from the character recognition software because of fonts, low resolution prints, water damage, handwritten notes, preexisting typos and so on.
    I will do my best to correct them all, but I have a feeling there will still be a few floating around.
    The formatting is not all consistent. This is a result of the combination of a large volume of content with a limited time budget.
    If you're reading this, good on you. 
    Sometimes web developers hide easter eggs in the comments.

            <h5>Determining pH with Fisher Acument Model 23A pH/Ion Meter </h5><br>

            Temperature should be set on 25 °C. Function should be set on pH.<br>
            Refill electrode with pH electrode filling solution as needed to keep it filled up to the hole.<br><br>
            
            
            <strong>Calibration</strong><br><br>
            
            1.	Remove electrode from storing solution. Slide plastic tubing down to uncover hole on electrode.<br>
            2.	Rinse electrode with distilled water and blot dry with Kim-wipe. Never touch the tip of the electrode. It is very thin and will easily break.<br>
            3.	Store electrode temporarily in distilled water if it will be more than about 5 seconds between readings. Always blot electrode before placing it into standard reference solution. <br>
            4.	Place electrode into beaker of pH 4 reference solution.<br>
            5. Move switch from "standby" to ''use".<br>
            6.	If meter does not read 4.0, use standardize knob to set it on 4.0.<br>
            7.	Move switch to pH Ref. between readings.<br>
            8.	Rinse electrode with distilled water and blot dry.<br>
            9.	Place electrode into beaker of pH 7 reference solution.<br>
            10.	If meter does not read 7.0, use standardize knob to set on 7.0.<br>
            11.	Check standards to see that they now read 4.0 and 7.0. If not, repeat steps 4-10. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Reading samples</strong><br><br>

            1.	Weigh 20 g soil into cup or beaker.<br>
            2.	Add 20 ml distilled water to cup.<br>
            3.	Stir with glass stir rod.<br>
            4.	Let sit 30 minutes.<br>
            5. Stir again and read pH. Make sure solution covers the dot about W' from the tip of the electrode.<br>
            6.	Rinse electrode between readings.<br>
            7.	After all readings are completed, return switch to "STBY" for storage.<br>
            8.	Place electrode into storage solution.<br>
            9.	Slide plastic tubing up to cover the hole.<br>

        <h5>Media sterilization</h5>
        <p>Colonies happily reproduce when fungal spores or bacteria-laden microscopic particles make contact with your plates, broths, and tubes; and your precious media will eventually resemble something out of an abandoned full refrigerator. One can't recognize individual colonies when the plates are covered with fuzz! No untreated surface in the lab is sterile, and nearly all dust and other particles have spores or active cells on their surfaces. All labware and all media must be sterilized before use. We sterilize most media and supplies using a steam autoclave that produces moist heat. Other methods, including filtration, ethylene oxide, radiation, or ultraviolet light may be necessary if components are heat-liable or materials are not heat resistant.</p>

        <p> An autoclave is designed to deliver steam into a pressure chamber, generating high heat and pressure at the same time. Heating media to above 121 degrees C for a minimum of 20 min. should destroy all living cells and spores. High pressure (typically 20 lbs/sq in) allows the temperature to exceed 100 degrees without boiling off the water from the solutions being sterilized. We use an autoclave that starts timing when the temperature reaches 121 degrees, and exhausts the steam slowly after the prescribed time above 121 degrees (to prevent exploding bottles!). The autoclave is effectively a giant pressure cooker.</p><br>

        To properly use an autoclave:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Know the instrument - some are fully automatic, some are fully manual</li>
            <li>Prepare supplies properly - the more layers or greater the volume, the longer it will take for the interior to heat up</li>
            <li> Check the steam pressure and ensure that the instrument is set for slow exhaust if liquids are to be sterilized</li>
            <li>Ensure that the door is closed properly and securely</li>
            <li>Check that the time and/or automatic cycle are set properly</li>
            <li>Ensure that the temperature is well below 100 degrees before attempting to open the door</li>
            <li>Crack the door to allow steam to vent, keeping face and hands well away from the opening</li>
            <li><strong><em>CAUTION!</em></strong> Exposing tightly stoppered bottles to variable pressures invites explosion and injury. When heating any liquids using any method, take care disturbing the flask or bottle. Material near the bottom may be superheated and boil over when moved. Stoppers, caps, covers, must be vented - never make them fit tightly.</li>
        </ul>

        
        
        
        <h5>Aseptic technique</h5>
        <p>The media on which you culture desirable microorganisms will readily grow undesirable contaminants; especially molds, other types of fungus, and bacteria from your skin and hair. It is therefore essential that you protect your cultures from contamination from airborne spores and living microorganisms, surface contaminants that may be on your instruments, and from skin contact.</p>

        <p>Bacteria and other contaminants cannot fly. Nearly all forms of contamination are carried on microscopic dust particles that make their way onto sterile surfaces when they are carelessly handled. One exception is insect contamination, such as by ants or fruit flies. Fruit flies are a particular nuisance because they can crawl under the lids of agar plates and lay eggs. You would think that people doing genetics research would have developed a model by now that can't fly into other peoples' experiments!</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Never leave a culture dish open, even for a short time when viewing colonies of organisms, unless you intend to destroy it</li>
            <li>When it is necessary to open a dish, keep the lid close to the dish, open it only as far and as long as is necessary to accomplish the procedure, and keep the lid between your face (and your germs!) and the agar surface.</li>
            <li>For most bacterial cultures you will use a sterile loop or needle to inoculate or to obtain an inoculum.</li>
            <li>Flame a loop or needle to red-hot just prior to use, burning off any organic material</li>
            <li>Cool the instrument by touching the sterile agar or liquid surface prior to touching a culture (or else you will kill it)</li>
            <li>Re-sterilize the instrument after performing the procedure, putting down safely without burning the bench, you, or another student</li>
            <li>Pass the neck of a culture tube or any container with a culture or sterile contents through a flame before taking off the cap. Hold the cap with opening down, and the tube horizontal or nearly so. Convection from the heated neck will prevent dust from falling into the opening. Flame again before putting the cap back <small>(see <a href="#smear">'preparing a bacterial smear'</a>)</small></li>
            <li>Use sterile disposable pipets to remove samples from a broth culture that must be kept uncontaminated.</li>
            <li>Always be aware of where your hands are,where your face is, and whether or not your culture is in a position to be contaminated. If you have long hair, make sure it does not hang into your plate. Hair is full of potential contaminants, and is one of the principle sources of contaminant microorganisms.</li>
            <li>If you have an open flame, long hair that is not tied back or loose clothing can be hazardous to your health.</li>
            <li>Keep flammables away from the flames, including alcohol used for sterilizing instruments. Do not place a heated loop or glass rod into an alcohol dish.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>A contaminated culture can often be rescued; however, there is always the risk that you will re­isolate the wrong microorganism. Besides, you don't have that kind of time to waste. Exercise extreme care to keep your cultures pure.</p>

            <h5>Maintenance of lnoculum</h5>

            <p>
                Isolates are maintained on half strength of PDA. This agar is prepared by adding O.1 g of Streptomycin and 0.1 g of neomycin per liter when agar has cooled down to 55°F. Inoculated plates are incubated in the dark at 24°C for two to three weeks.<br>
                
                Inoculum increase<br>
                The fungus is increased on 100 g of sorghum seeds that are soaked overnight in 250 ml flasks. Next morning drain extra water, cover, and autoclave. Wait 24 hours and autoclave again. When cooled, inoculate flask with 5-7 plugs (8mm diameter) of actively growing fungal mycelium and incubate at 24°C in dark for two weeks.<br>
                
                
                Inoculations<br>
                Seedbed inoculations: A mixture of steam-treated field soil, sand, and ProMix (1:1:1) is used for greenhouse assay. One to two infested sorghum seeds are planted with each soybean seed. Water lightly and keep under 14 h day light with 70-75°F day and 60°F night temperatures. Maintain the soil near water holding capacity. Seedlings were scored three weeks after emergence.<br>
                
                Seedling inoculation: Germinate seeds in ProMix or sand in 'cel-paks.' Remove 12-14 day old seedlings from the sand or ProMix and wash thoroughly, being careful to avoid any root injury. Transfer to 3-5 in. diameter plastic pots containing soil-sand-ProMix mixture (1:1:1). 5-8 Fsg infested sorghum seeds are placed next to the taproot of each seedling and roots are covered with same soil mix. Pots are kept under 14 h day light with 70-75°F day and 60°F night temperatures. Fertilize bimonthly with a dilute (1/4 strength) of an all-purpose greenhouse liquid fertilizer. Seedlings started scoring after the appearance of first visible foliar symptoms. Seedlings can be kept up to 60 days in the greenhouse.<br>

            1.	Fill a plastic garbage can with tap water and 15 bags of sorghum seed** (each bag is ~70 lbs, therefore ~105 lbs of seed is needed). Soak for 12 hours or overnight.<br>
            o	Remove any floating debris accumulated In garbage can after soaking.<br>
            2.	Drain and rinse sorghum seed:<br>
            o	Place container (e.g.Rubbermaid) with holesin bottom of the sink; line contained with plastic mesh.<br>
            o	Fill almost to the top with soaked sorghum seed.<br>
            o	Run tap water from the hose over the sorghumseed until the water comes out clear (not brown) from the bottom of the container.<br>
            o	Letthe seed drain for 5 minutes.<br>
            3.	Weigh 8 lbs of drained sorghum seed in a clear plastic autoclave bag on a scale (i.e. Include weight of bag on scale).<br>
            o	Tip: A 1000 ml plastic beaker filled 4 times equals approximately 8 lbs.<br>
            o		Remove air from bag; place a foam plug in neck of bag and tie a string around outside of bagto secure foam plug while continually pushing air out.<br>
            4.	Autoclave bag for 1 hour on "liquids" setting at 121°C. <br>
            o	Store on floor to cool overnight. <br>
            5.	The following day, autoclave bag again for 1 hour on "liquids" setting at 121°C. °
            o	Let bag cool. <br>
            6.	Inoculate autoclaved sorghum seed: <br>
            o	Under the hood, inoculate sorghum seed with 8Sg of SOS lnoculum from a flask that has grownfor 10 days (or 2 weeks - see inoculum increase protocol above). <br>
            o	Store Inoculated bag at 70°F.<br>
            o	Let the inoculum grow for a few days, then shake bag each day to break up and distribute inoculum. <br>
            **Heather will decide between 1 g/ft (i.e. 4800 g) o 2 g/ft (I.e. 9600 g) of inoculated seed used for planting; will need to prepare enough for 11 lbs of sorghum only!

            <p>
                <h6>Considerations for Obtaining Meaningful Field SDS Ratings</h6>
                
                Site Selection:<br>
                To obtain valid comparisons among varieties in a field test, it is essential to have reasonable uniform disease pressure. Therefore, we choose fields with a history of severe SOS occurring uniformly throughout the field in several previous seasons. In addition, we require a SDS test plot to be level or very gently sloped, and to have a uniform soil type. In order to maintain our preferred com-soybean rotation, we scout potential fields at peak SOS expression two years before we want to use them. We have found it important to scout fields ourselves, for what is "bad SOS throughout the field" to a farmer may be woefully variable for a variety test.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Experimental Design:<br>
                Reducing Spatial Variability<br>
                Because SOS symptom development so strongly depends on the interaction of weather conditions with the stage of plant development, we conduct a separate trial for each one-half maturity group when it is practical. This benefit is two-fold. It allows for better com11arisons within maturity groups and it keeps trials physically small thus reducing spatial variability.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Planting<br>
                Since early planting dates have proven to be conducive to disease development, trials are planted as early as possible. Most trials involve 2-row, 10 ft. plots. We consider two rows sufficient since our experience has failed to identify any border effects.<br>
                When possible, the land is prepared by no-till practices. If post-emergence weed control is needed, we generally use spot spraying, cultivation and/or hand weeding. To eliminate interference with SOS ratings we rigorously avoid herbicides that cause any soybean leaf damage past the V4 stage.
                Irrigated locations offer the greatest guarantee of SDS symptoms. However, keep in mind that during a drought year, even irrigation will have a difficult time mimicking natural rainfall.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rating Leaf Symptoms<br>
                Disease symptoms are rated as close as possible to the R6 stage (at which seeds have just reached full size), but before the earliest maturing entries have started to senesce. This is when leaf symptom expression is most developed. When other leaf diseases are prominent, it is sometimes necessary to rate earlier than R6 to avoid masking of SOS by the other diseases. R­ stages are pictured on the following page.<br>
                Disease incidence (DI) is the percentage of plants in the plot with leaf symptoms.<br>
                Disease severity (DS) is pictured on the following page. It is recorded on a I to 9 scale with increments of 0.5.<br>
                Disease index (DX) is calculated as DI x DS/9, and has a range of 0 (no disease) to 100 (all plants dead before R6).

                Determining R-stage: All descriptions apply to at least one pod at any of the four uppermost nodes. Other pads at these same nodes may not be fully developed. Stages are determined by seed and pod development on the main stem. By R5.O, the leaf at the terminal node is normally fully developed, so the phrase "with a fully developed leaf" was omitted from the description of the four uppermost nodes.

            Single spore isolation:<br>
            1)	Water agar (1-2%) is prepared<br>
            2)	Pick up mycelia using a sterile loop from VS plates (Good sporulation)<br>
            3)	Streak out the mycelia on the water agar in much the same way we would with bacteria to get individual colonies<br>
            4)	After incubating in the dark for 12-24 hours, use a dissecting scope and a sterile needle to pick individual germinated spores off of the plate<br>
            5)	May also try to look for hyphae coming from germinated spores in water agar and, cut off the tip of a hypha that derived from a single spore<br>
            6)	Then subculture them in a new culture medium (PDA or VS) (In general, PDA is only used to maintain the initial mycelial growth and long term storage; V8 is good for inducing sporulation)<br>

            <h6>Inoculum processes</h6>
            Growing the plants<br>
            1)  Choose a disease-susceptible soybean variety to plant in the greenhouse. Use big or small pots, as desired. Make four evenly spaced holes in the soil of each pot and deposit 2-3 seeds in each hole. <br>
            2)	In 8 to 10 days, plants need be thinned out to yield 4 plants per pot. Plants should then be fertilized with Osmocote. <br>
            3)	Within 2 weeks of planti ng, plants need be staked with 12"wooden skewers to keep them from becoming entangled.<br>
            Growing the pathogen and inoculum preparation<br>
            4)	<em>Cercospora sojina</em> (or other relevant pathogens) must be cultured on the same day the plants are planted (step 1). Four plates are usually sufficient to make enough conidial suspension to inoculate 12 soybeans at the V4 growth stay, but you should culture 6 plates just in case of culture contamination or lack of sporulation. Culture the isolate(s) on fresh Y8 media. Wrap in parafilm and incubate in complete darkness at 24°C for about 3 weeks to allow for conidia production.<br>
            5)	After 3 weeks, harvest conidia by flooding the plates with approxi mately 15 ml of a 0.05% Tween 80 solution per plate.<br>
            a.	Protocol for preparing the Tween 80 stock solution:  In a 1 L beaker. mix 500 mL of sterile deionized water and 1.5 mL of Tween 80. Stir on a magnetic stirrer until the Tween 80 is completely dissolved . It may take some time, but the Tween 80 will go into solution. This stock solution (0.3%) may be stored for some time in the flammables cabinet. Check the stock solution before each use.  If it is cloudy or shows signs of preci pitation, make a new solution before use. <br>
            b.	To prepare  the 0.05% Tween  80 solution: Use the formula C1V 1= C2V2 to make 500 ml of the 0.05% Tween 80 from the 0.3% stock Tween 80 solution (see Sa). This is achieved by taking 83 ml of 0.3% Tween 80 and combining with 417ml of sterile deionized water. <br>
            6)  The surface of each fungal colony should be scraped using a sterile wooden coffee stirrer, or other similar device, and then the suspension needs to be filtered through four layers of sterile cheesecloth. <br>
            7)	The concentration of conidia in the filtrate should be measured using a hemocytometer and 1O μL of the suspension. Adjust to the required concentrations by further diluting it with 0.05% Tween 80 solution. We typically use a final concentration of 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> spores/ml to inoculate the plants in the greenhouse. <br>
            a.	Directions   for hemocytometer   usage: Determining the concentration  of spores  in suspension using a hemocytom eter requires that you count spores in certain squares based  on your total counts, dilution  factor. initial  volume, and desired  final  density. The central  square of the hemocytometer  (encircled  in red) has grids of different sizes. Take care that that you  know the grid size and height  (read  the instruction  manual), otherwise you'll  make  calculation  errors.   Use the central square (reference the bottom  left image), which  is divided  into 25 smaller squares, such that the squares highlighted  in blue are additionally  subdivided into  16 smaller squares (see middle image below)  and these blue squares are the ones within which you will  count the individual  cells; however  the size of your spores and  the density of your suspension  will influence which square-size within which you will need to count. For example, if your spores are small and high in concentration count within the smallest or 'red' squares (as displayed in part 7b); otherwise count within the 'yellow' or 'blue' squares. Do not count cells on the top and right lines (sec bottom right image).<br>

        8)	For soybean plants at growth stage V4, a total volume of 2.5 ml of inoculum suspension is enough to inoculate a single plant.<br>

        9)	Directly following inoculation, plants must be incubated in a dew chamber at 24°C for 24 hours. After that the plants should be moved to a plastic chamber to maintain high relative humidity until symptoms appear.<br>

        10) Check the plants for symptoms daily 5 days post-inoculation. Timing may vary depending on isolates used and ambient conditions.<br>

        <h5>Protocol for preservation of isolates: Filter paper</h5>
        1.  Cut a Whatman #1 filter paper into small triangle pieces and put them ina small glass beaker for autoclaving.<br>
        2.	In a second glass beaker, put in small coin envelopes.<br>
        3.	Autoclave both containers at 121°C (15 psi) for at least 20 minutes.<br>
        4.	Prepare media of choice in the typical manner. For Cercospora sojina we recommend full-strength PDA.<br>
        5.	If preserving new isolates, monoconidial cultures are required (See single spore isolation protocol). These cultures should be 2-3 weeks old prior to attempting the preservation protocol.<br>
        6.	Do this under a laminar flow hood. Use sterile forceps to deposit the previously sterilized filter paper directly onto your agar of choice. Ifyour agar was poured into large petri plates, you can place about 3-4 filter paper triangles (depending on the size of your filter paper) on the agar. Do not overlap the filter papers. Ifusing small petri dishes, use 1-2 filter papers.<br>
        7.	From the mycelial culture you wish to preserve, take a plug or cut out a small piece of mycelium and deposit onto the center of the agar plate containing the filter paper(s). The fungal fragment does not need to be directly upon the filter paper. Seal plate with parafilm or place in a crisper box under lab conditions.<br>
        8.	Repeat step 7 for all isolates as many times as desired.<br>
        9.	Allow the cultures to colonize the filter paper (3-4 weeks). Then, under the laminar flow hood, lift the paper from the agar using sterile forceps and place in the previously sterilized coin envelopes. Filter papers from the same plate can be placed in the same envelope. Different isolates deserve different envelopes. Make sure to label envelopes appropriately (sample origin, date of isolation, date stored). Leave the filter papers in the coin envelopes in the hood to dry overnight.<br>
        10.	Place the coin envelopes in a closed plastic container lined with silica gel sorbent, and stored at -20°C until required.<br>
        11.	To grow out the filter paper specimen, cut small pieces of the paper using sterile forceps (under laminar flow hood) by holding the base of the paper inside the envelope and pulling the opposite site with the forceps. Plate the small filter piece(s) covered with fungal mycelium ina fresh PDA medium.<br>
        12.	Place the plates in a crisper box (or wrap in parafilm) and incubate under lab conditions.<br>
        13.	To increase conidia production, transfer the culture to V8 plates and incubate in complete darkness at 24-25°C. Ifsporulation is not of interest, plates can be left on the benchtop under typical lab conditions.<br>

        <h5>Preparing the spore suspension for the conldlal germination assay</h5>
        
            A)	If using leaf samples:
            <ol>
                <li>Place leaf sample with the underside facing up under a dissectingscope</li>
                <li>Use a 10 or 20 ul pipette to deposit a small volume (10-20ul) of sterile deionized water onto a single FLS lesion.While viewingthe lesion under the microscope,pipette the water droplet up and down to dislodge the conidia. The small silvery spores can be seen floating In the water drop once they have been dislodged.</li>
                <li>After all of the conidia on one lesion have been dislodged,use the same pipettetip to suction up that spore suspension and transfer itto another FLS lesion and repeat the process of dislodgingthe spores.</li>
                <li>Once satisfied that a water droplet has been saturated with spores,deposit the droplet onto the underside lid of one of the petri dishes you will be using.Pool all of your spore suspensions from one sample inthe same location.</li>
                <li>Repeat the process as often as needed. Use a total of 50-60ul of water to generate the spore suspension.Obtain conldla from multiple lesions on at least 5 different leaves, if possible. The specific number will vary depending on the level of sporulatlon on the FLS lesions,as well and the severity of infection.</li>
                <li>After all of the spore suspensions have been pooled onto the underside of the lid,gently pipette the droplet up and down to better distribute the spores In the suspension. Then take 25-30ul of the pooled suspension and deposit onto the middle of an unamended petri dish. Take the remaining 25 30ul and deposit onto the fungicide-amended petri dish.</li>
                <li>Use a sterile glass rod to gently swirlthe suspensions onto the media,first the unamended plate then the amended plate.</li>
                <li>Label the plates with the date,time,number of leaves used,and the sample name.</li>
                <li>Leave assays in a dark place or wrap infoil for 14-18 hours and then evaluate for spore germination using a compound light microscope. Record the number of germinated and non-germinated spores on each plate.Count 100 spores on each plate whenever possible. Record the date and time of assessment.</li>
            </ol>
            B)	If using fungal mycelium:
           <ol>
                <li>Flood the <em>C. sojina</em> culture with 3-5ml of sterile deionized water.</li>
                <li>Use a sterile L-shaped plastic or glass rod to crush the mycelium in the water and dislodge the spores.</li>
                <li>Filter the spore suspension through a few layers of cheesecloth to remove mycelial fragments from the suspension.</li>
                <li>
                    Deposit about 30ul of the conidial spore suspension onto unamended and fungicide­ amended plates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use a sterile glass rod to gently swirlthe suspensions onto the media, first the
                    unamended plate then the amended plate.
                </li>
                <li>Label the plates with the date,time,and the sample name.</li>
                <li>Leave assays In darkness or wrap In foil for 14-18 hours and then evaluate for spore germination using a compound light microscope. Record the number of germinated and non-germinated spores on each plate. Count 100 spores on each plate whenever possible. Also record the date and time of assessment.</li>

        <h5>Characterization of azoxystrobin sensitivity using media-coated glass slides</h5>

        <p><strong>Stock solutions</strong><br> 
            First, it is necessary to make stock solutions of both azoxystrobin and SHAM. To make a concentration of 100 mg/ml (100,000 µg/ml), weigh out 0.104 g of technical grade azoxystrobin (96% a.i) and dilute in 1 ml of acetone.</p>

        <p>Using the formula CIVI = C2V2, make 10-fold dilutions by taking 100 µI of the first concentration and mixing in 900 µI of acetone (10 mg/ml). In total, make S stock solutions: 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 µg/ml.</p>

        <p>For SHAM, make only one stock solution of 60 mg/ml by weighting 0.06 g of SHAM and diluting in 1mlof methanol. Vortex vigorously until completely dissolved. Place in 55°C water bath for a few minutes if having trouble dissolving.</p>

        <p>In both cases, the final concentration of both solvents: acetone and methanol in the media should be 0.1% (voYvol). Therefore, diluting 60 µl of each stock solution in 60 ml of media, the final concentration of the solvents will be 0.1%.</p>

        <p>Note: Both SHAM and Azoxystrobin are light-sensitive so keep out of light as much as possible. Wrap stocks inaluminum foil.</p>

        <p>Fungicide sensitivity. The media-coated glass slides use microscopic slides covered with full strength PDA. For each isolate-fungicide concentration, three replicate slides should be used.</p>

        <p>
            1.	Weight 2.34 g of PDA (Becton Dickinson: BD) and fill with 60 ml of water, using small Erlenmeyer beaker (± 200 ml of capacity), for each fungicide concentration. In total use 6 fungicide concentrations (included unamended fungicide).<br>
            2.	Autoclave at 121°C (1S psi) for 15 to 20 minutes.<br>
            3.	Cool media using water bath until 50-55°C.<br>
            4.	In a laminar flow hood, add 60 µl of each fungicide concentration plus 60 µl of SHAM solution per each media. The stock solutions and the final fungicide concentrations obtained are:<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Fungicide stock solution (μg/ml)</th>		<th>Final fungicide concentration (μg/ml)</th></tr>
                <tr><td>10,000</td>	<td>10</td></tr>

        <h5>Simple Stain</h5>

        <p>Simple stains provide a quick and easy way to determine cell shape, size, and arrangement.</p>
        

        <ol>
            <li>Perform a bacterial smear, as discussed in Figure 3-52 on page 150 of your lab manual.</li>
    
            <li>Saturate the smear with basic dye for approximately 1 minute.  You may use crystal violet, safranin, or methylene blue.</li>
            
            <li>Rinse the slide gently with water.</li>
            
            <li>Carefully blot dry with bibulous paper.</li>
            
            <li>Observe the slide under the microscope, using proper microscope technique.</li>
        </ol>
            
        <h5>Negative Stain</h5>

        <p>Negative staining is an excellent way to determine an organism's cellular morphology. Since the cells themselves are not stained, their morphology is not distorted in any way. The nigrosin provides a dark background against which the shapes of the unstained cells are clearly visible. This method provides a high degree of contrast not available in most other staining procedures.</p>
        

        <ol>
            <li>Place a single drop of nigrosin on a clean microscope slide, adjacent to the frosted edge.</li>
            <li>Using a flamed loop and sterile technique, remove some organism from your tu be or plate and mix it into the drop of nigrosin. Be sure there are no large clumps of organism, but try to avoid spreading the drop.</li>
    
            <li>Place the end of another clean microscope slide at an angle to the end of the slide containing the organism and spread the drop out into a film. This is done by contacting the drop of nigrosin with the clean microscope slide and using the capillary action of the dye/microscope slide to spread the nigrosin across the smear:</li>
    
            <img src="images/stain-1.jpg" width="80%"> 

            <li>Allow the film to air dry.</li>

            <li>Rinse the slide gently with water.</li>
            
            <li>Decolorize with Gram decolorizer (acetone/alcohol) for 3-5 seconds ONLY; if you leave the decolorizer on too long, it will bleach the crystal violet out of a gram positive cell!</li>
            
            <li>Rinse the slide gently with water.</li>
            
            <li>Counterstain with safranin for 1 minute.</li>
            
            <li>Rinse the slide gently with water.</li>
            
            <li>Carefully blot the slide dry with bibulous paper.</li>

            <li>Observe the slide under the microscope, using proper microscope technique.</li> 
        </ol>
        <p>
            With proper staining technique:<br>
            Gram positive bacteria will stain purple. <br>

            <h5>Identifying bacteria </h5> 
            
            A...Prepare a suspension of each unknown at @ 10^8 cfu/ml in a labeled test tube containing 4 ml of sterile tap. Samples can be compared to a spectrophotometer standardized bacterial suspension (OD 0.3 at 600nm) which will be provided. Be sure to maintain culture purity during preparation of the suspensions.<br>
            
            B...Use a micropipette and sterile pipet tips to transfer 25 µL of each suspension onto media (3 strains/plate) listed below and subsequently use a flame-sterilized and cooled inoculating loop to spread the suspensions over the surface of the media. Be careful not to cross-contaminate the 3 cultures (use different tips for each culture and re-flame the inoculating loop between samples).	<br>
            
            Media(page number in lab guide) - incubate all plates at 28°C, except growth at 37°C test, and check at days 2-7 after plating:<br>
            
            YDC (4) -observe plates for bacteria color and production of diffusible pigments<br>
            
            KMB (4) -observe plates under long-wave UV light for production of diffusible fluorescent pigments	<br>
            
            NA+7% NaCl (3) -observe plates for bacterial growth (high salt tolerance) <br>

            DIM (9)-observe plates for bacterial growth (utilization of cellobiose)<br>

            Levan (93 -observe plates for white mucoid, dome-shaped growth indicating levan production from sucrose <br>
            
            TTC (154) -observe plates for bacterial growth and color on tetrazolium chloride<br>
            
            Arginine/Betaine (145) -observe plates for bacterial growth indicating use of Arginine and/or Betaine as carbon source, compare with ø plates containing no carbohydrate <br>
            
            Growth on D-Sorbitol (96,Ayer's basal medium) -observe plates for bacterial growth and color change of media, compare with ø Ayer's plate containing no carbohydrate <br>
            
            Hugh and Leifson (9) -observe plates for bacterial growth and media color change to yellow indicating oxidative metabolism of glucose <br>
                
            NA+copper (3) -observe plates for bacterial growth indicating copper resistance at 200 ppm <br>
            
            Growth at 37°C YNA (179) -observe plates for .bacterial growth at 37°C <br>

            C...Use a flame-sterilized straight inoculating wire to stab inoculate each bacterium into a test tube containing 4 ml of Hugh and Leifson medium (9) and cover the media with 1 ml of sterile mineral oil using a sterile pipet tip. Incubate the tube at 28°C and observe for a color change to yellow indicating fermentative metabolism of glucose.
 
            D...Use a flame-sterilized inoculating loop to patch (spot) inoculate (@about the size of a dime) each bacterium onto plates of starch medium (144) and lactose medium (3- ketolactose,24) and incubate the plates at 28°C for 2 days.

            After 2 days, pipet @ 500 µl of Lugol's Iodine solution onto the surface of the starch plate and observe the plate for clear, colorless zones sound bacteria indicating starch hydrolysis (iodine will stain the starch blue in the surrounding background area).

            After 2 days, pipet @ 500 µl of Benedict's reagent onto the surface of the lactose plate and observe the plate for a yellow ring of Cu2O around bacteria indicating the presence of 3-ketolactose (reaction takes @30-60 minutes to develop)

            E..Test bacteria for Gram reaction (7) by mixing a loopful of bacterial growth into 1-2 drops of 3% KOH on a microscope slide. Gram-negative bacteria will become gummy and will produce strings (due to cell lysis and release of DNA) upon mixing, Gram­ positive bacteria will not.

            F...Use a hypodermic syringe and needle to infiltrate the bacterial suspensions produced in step A of the procedure into the mesophyll of leaves of tobacco and pepper. Label the inoculated leaves and incubate the plants at 28°C in the growth room. Check the plants at 24h, 48h, and 5 days after inoculation to observe HR and additional inoculation phenotypes.

            <h5>How to do Gram Stains</h5>

            <h6>List of Reagents and Instruments </h6>
            Equipment: <br>            
            Bunsen burner, alcohol-cleaned microscope slide, water<br>
            
            Reagents:
            Crystal violet, Gram's iodine solution, acetone/ethanol (50:50 v:v), 0.1% basic fuchsin solution
            
            <h6>Procedures</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare a Slide Smear:</li>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Transfer a drop of the suspended culture to be examined on a slide with an inoculation loop. If the culture is to be taken from a Petri dish or a slant culture tube, first add a drop or a few loopfuls of water on the slide and aseptically transfer a minute amount of a colony from the Petri dish. Note that only a very small amount of culture is needed; a visual detection of the culture on an inoculation loop already indicates that too much is taken.<br>
                        
                        If staining a clinical specimen, smear a very thin layer onto the slide using a wooden stick. If at all possible, do not use a cotton swab; because the cotton fibers may appear as artefacts. The smear should be thin enough to dry completely ·within a few seconds. Stain does not penetrate thickly applied specimens, making interpretation very difficult.
                    </li>
                    
                   <li>Spread the culture with an inoculation loop to an even, thin film over a circle of 1.5 cm in diameter, approximately the size of a dime. Thus, a typical slide can simultaneously accommodate 3 to 4 small smears if more than one culture is to be examined.</li>
                   <li>Air-dry the culture and fix it or over a gentle flame while moving the slide in a circular fashion to avoid localized overheating. The applied heat helps the cell adhere to the glass slide and make possible the subsequent rinsing of the smear without a significant loss of the culture. Heat can also be applied to facilitate drying the smear. However, ring patterns can form if heating is not uniform, e.g. taking the slide in and out of the flame.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <li>Gram Staining:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add crystal violet stain over the fixed culture. Let stand for 10 to 60 seconds; for thinly prepared slides, it is usually acceptable to pour the stain on and off immediately. Pour off the stain and gently rinse the excess stain with a stream of water from a faucet or a plastic water bottle. Note that the objective of this step is to wash off the stain, not the fixed culture.</li>
                    
                   <li>Add the iodine solution on the smear, enough to cover the fixed culture. Let stand for 10 to 60 seconds. Pour off the iodine solution and rinse the slide with running water. Shake off the excess water from the surface.</li>
                    <li>Add a few drops of decolorizer so the solution trickles down the slide. Rinse it off with water after 5 seconds. The exact time to stop is when the solvent is no longer colored as it flows over the slide. Further delay will cause excess decolorization in the gram-positive cell, and the purpose of staining will be defeated.</li>
                    
                   <li>Counterstain with basic fuchsin solution for 40 to 60 seconds. Wash off the solution with water. Blot with bibulous paper to remove the excess water. Alternatively, the slide may be shaken to remove most of the water and air-dried.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <li>Quality control:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a simple matter to prepare a control slide by breaking a clean wooden applicator stick and picking a small amount of material from the interproximal space of one's teeth. This should be smeared into a drop of clean tap water on a clean glass slide. The slide may be stained as above. This material will consistently display a few neutrophils and a mixture of Gram (+) and (-) organisms. Neutrophil nuclei should be pink.</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                <li>Examine the finished slide under a microscope.</li>
               <ul> 
                   <li>
                       A caveat in the examination of the Gram smears is the distortion in morphology that can be caused by antimicrobial therapy. This is especially likely to occur in urine speciments. Filamentous and pleomorphic forms may be observed among the Gram (-) rod species. Gram reaction of the organism may also change after antimicrobial therapy, Gram (+) bacterial may become gram variable. Look at areas that are one cell thick only; observation of thick areas will give variable and often incorrect results. White blood cells and macrophages should stain Gram-negative, whereas squamous epithelial cells are Gram-positive.</li>
