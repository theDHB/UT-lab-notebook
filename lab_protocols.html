    This web version of our lab notebook was created by David Boyd.
    It was created from a scanned PDF of the notebook.
    The notebook had been rained on, and all its pages disordered.
    Much of the PDF-to-docx conversion resulted in transcription errors from the character recognition software because of fonts, low resolution prints, water damage, handwritten notes, preexisting typos and so on.
    I will do my best to correct them all, but I have a feeling there will still be a few floating around.
    The formatting is not all consistent. This is a result of the combination of a large volume of content with a limited time budget.
    If you're reading this, good on you. 
    Sometimes web developers hide easter eggs in the comments.

            <h5>Determining pH with Fisher Acument Model 23A pH/Ion Meter </h5><br>

            Temperature should be set on 25 °C. Function should be set on pH.<br>
            Refill electrode with pH electrode filling solution as needed to keep it filled up to the hole.<br><br>
            
            
            <strong>Calibration</strong><br><br>
            
            1.	Remove electrode from storing solution. Slide plastic tubing down to uncover hole on electrode.<br>
            2.	Rinse electrode with distilled water and blot dry with Kim-wipe. Never touch the tip of the electrode. It is very thin and will easily break.<br>
            3.	Store electrode temporarily in distilled water if it will be more than about 5 seconds between readings. Always blot electrode before placing it into standard reference solution. <br>
            4.	Place electrode into beaker of pH 4 reference solution.<br>
            5. Move switch from "standby" to ''use".<br>
            6.	If meter does not read 4.0, use standardize knob to set it on 4.0.<br>
            7.	Move switch to pH Ref. between readings.<br>
            8.	Rinse electrode with distilled water and blot dry.<br>
            9.	Place electrode into beaker of pH 7 reference solution.<br>
            10.	If meter does not read 7.0, use standardize knob to set on 7.0.<br>
            11.	Check standards to see that they now read 4.0 and 7.0. If not, repeat steps 4-10. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Reading samples</strong><br><br>

            1.	Weigh 20 g soil into cup or beaker.<br>
            2.	Add 20 ml distilled water to cup.<br>
            3.	Stir with glass stir rod.<br>
            4.	Let sit 30 minutes.<br>
            5. Stir again and read pH. Make sure solution covers the dot about W' from the tip of the electrode.<br>
            6.	Rinse electrode between readings.<br>
            7.	After all readings are completed, return switch to "STBY" for storage.<br>
            8.	Place electrode into storage solution.<br>
            9.	Slide plastic tubing up to cover the hole.<br>

    <div class="col col-12" id="media-sterilization">
        <h5>Media sterilization</h5>
        <p>Colonies happily reproduce when fungal spores or bacteria-laden microscopic particles make contact with your plates, broths, and tubes; and your precious media will eventually resemble something out of an abandoned full refrigerator. One can't recognize individual colonies when the plates are covered with fuzz! No untreated surface in the lab is sterile, and nearly all dust and other particles have spores or active cells on their surfaces. All labware and all media must be sterilized before use. We sterilize most media and supplies using a steam autoclave that produces moist heat. Other methods, including filtration, ethylene oxide, radiation, or ultraviolet light may be necessary if components are heat-liable or materials are not heat resistant.</p>

        <p> An autoclave is designed to deliver steam into a pressure chamber, generating high heat and pressure at the same time. Heating media to above 121 degrees C for a minimum of 20 min. should destroy all living cells and spores. High pressure (typically 20 lbs/sq in) allows the temperature to exceed 100 degrees without boiling off the water from the solutions being sterilized. We use an autoclave that starts timing when the temperature reaches 121 degrees, and exhausts the steam slowly after the prescribed time above 121 degrees (to prevent exploding bottles!). The autoclave is effectively a giant pressure cooker.</p><br>

        To properly use an autoclave:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Know the instrument - some are fully automatic, some are fully manual</li>
            <li>Prepare supplies properly - the more layers or greater the volume, the longer it will take for the interior to heat up</li>
            <li> Check the steam pressure and ensure that the instrument is set for slow exhaust if liquids are to be sterilized</li>
            <li>Ensure that the door is closed properly and securely</li>
            <li>Check that the time and/or automatic cycle are set properly</li>
            <li>Ensure that the temperature is well below 100 degrees before attempting to open the door</li>
            <li>Crack the door to allow steam to vent, keeping face and hands well away from the opening</li>
            <li><strong><em>CAUTION!</em></strong> Exposing tightly stoppered bottles to variable pressures invites explosion and injury. When heating any liquids using any method, take care disturbing the flask or bottle. Material near the bottom may be superheated and boil over when moved. Stoppers, caps, covers, must be vented - never make them fit tightly.</li>
        </ul>

        
        
        
        <h5>Aseptic technique</h5>
        <p>The media on which you culture desirable microorganisms will readily grow undesirable contaminants; especially molds, other types of fungus, and bacteria from your skin and hair. It is therefore essential that you protect your cultures from contamination from airborne spores and living microorganisms, surface contaminants that may be on your instruments, and from skin contact.</p>

        <p>Bacteria and other contaminants cannot fly. Nearly all forms of contamination are carried on microscopic dust particles that make their way onto sterile surfaces when they are carelessly handled. One exception is insect contamination, such as by ants or fruit flies. Fruit flies are a particular nuisance because they can crawl under the lids of agar plates and lay eggs. You would think that people doing genetics research would have developed a model by now that can't fly into other peoples' experiments!</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Never leave a culture dish open, even for a short time when viewing colonies of organisms, unless you intend to destroy it</li>
            <li>When it is necessary to open a dish, keep the lid close to the dish, open it only as far and as long as is necessary to accomplish the procedure, and keep the lid between your face (and your germs!) and the agar surface.</li>
            <li>For most bacterial cultures you will use a sterile loop or needle to inoculate or to obtain an inoculum.</li>
            <li>Flame a loop or needle to red-hot just prior to use, burning off any organic material</li>
            <li>Cool the instrument by touching the sterile agar or liquid surface prior to touching a culture (or else you will kill it)</li>
            <li>Re-sterilize the instrument after performing the procedure, putting down safely without burning the bench, you, or another student</li>
            <li>Pass the neck of a culture tube or any container with a culture or sterile contents through a flame before taking off the cap. Hold the cap with opening down, and the tube horizontal or nearly so. Convection from the heated neck will prevent dust from falling into the opening. Flame again before putting the cap back <small>(see <a href="#smear">'preparing a bacterial smear'</a>)</small></li>
            <li>Use sterile disposable pipets to remove samples from a broth culture that must be kept uncontaminated.</li>
            <li>Always be aware of where your hands are,where your face is, and whether or not your culture is in a position to be contaminated. If you have long hair, make sure it does not hang into your plate. Hair is full of potential contaminants, and is one of the principle sources of contaminant microorganisms.</li>
            <li>If you have an open flame, long hair that is not tied back or loose clothing can be hazardous to your health.</li>
            <li>Keep flammables away from the flames, including alcohol used for sterilizing instruments. Do not place a heated loop or glass rod into an alcohol dish.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>A contaminated culture can often be rescued; however, there is always the risk that you will re­isolate the wrong microorganism. Besides, you don't have that kind of time to waste. Exercise extreme care to keep your cultures pure.</p>

                <h5>SIUC Method of SDS Scoring</h5>
                Considerations for Obtaining Meaningful Field SDS Ratings<br><br>
                
                Site Selection<br>
                To obtain valid comparisons among varieties in a field test, it is essential to have reasonable uniform disease pressure. Therefore, we choose fields with a history of severe SOS occurring uniformly throughout the field in several previous seasons. In addition, we require a SDS test plot to be level or very gently sloped, and to have a uniform soil type. In order to maintain our preferred com-soybean rotation, we scout potential fields at peak SOS expression two years before we want to use them. We have found it important to scout fields ourselves, for what is "bad SOS throughout the field" to a farmer may be woefully variable for a variety test.<br><br>
                
                Experimental Design:<br>
                Reducing Spatial Variability<br>
                Because SOS symptom development so strongly depends on the interaction of weather conditions with the stage of plant development, we conduct a separate trial for each one-half maturity group when it is practical. This benefit is two-fold. It allows for better com11arisons within maturity groups and it keeps trials physically small thus reducing spatial variability.<br><br>
                
                Planting<br>
                Since early planting dates have proven to be conducive to disease development, trials are planted as early as possible. Most trials involve 2-row, 10 ft. plots. We consider two rows sufficient since our experience has failed to identify any border effects.<br>
                When possible, the land is prepared by no-till practices. If post-emergence weed control is needed, we generally use spot spraying, cultivation and/or hand weeding. To eliminate interference with SOS ratings we rigorously avoid herbicides that cause any soybean leaf damage past the V4 stage.
                Irrigated locations offer the greatest guarantee of SDS symptoms. However, keep in mind that during a drought year, even irrigation will have a difficult time mimicking natural rainfall.<br><br>
                
                Rating Leaf Symptoms<br>
                Disease symptoms are rated as close as possible to the R6 stage (at which seeds have just reached full size), but before the earliest maturing entries have started to senesce. This is when leaf symptom expression is most developed. When other leaf diseases are prominent, it is sometimes necessary to rate earlier than R6 to avoid masking of SOS by the other diseases. R­ stages are pictured on the following page.<br>
                Disease incidence (DI) is the percentage of plants in the plot with leaf symptoms.<br>
                Disease severity (DS) is pictured on the following page. It is recorded on a I to 9 scale with increments of 0.5.<br>
                Disease index (DX) is calculated as DI x DS/9, and has a range of O (no disease) to 100 (all plants dead before R6).

                Determining R-stage: All descriptions apply to at least one pad at any of the four uppermost nodes. Other pads at these same nodes may not be fully developed. Stages are determined by seed and pod development on the main stem. By RS.O, the leaf at the terminal node is normally fully developed, so the phrase "with a fully developed leaf" was omitted from the description of the four uppermost nodes.

            <h5><em>Cercospora sojina</em> Storage and Inoculation Protocols</h5>
            <h6>Binbin Lin</h6>
            Single spore isolation:
            1)	Water agar (1-2%) is prepared
            2)	Pick up mycelia using a sterile loop from VS plates (Good sporulation)
            3)	Streak out the mycelia on the water agar in much the same way we would with bacteria to get individual colonies
            4)	After incubating in the dark for 12-24 hours, use a dissecting scope and a sterile needle to pick individual germinated spores off of the plate
            5)	May also try to look for hyphae coming from germi nated spores in water agar and, cut off the tip of a
            hypha that derived from a single spore
            6)	Then subculture them in a new culture medi um (PDA or VS) (In general, PDA is only used to maintain the initial mycelial growth and long term storage; VS is good for inducing sporulation)

            Filter Paper Storage of Isolates in Freezer
            7) Place sterile filter paper onto quarter-strength potato dextrose agar plates
            S) Place pure culture onto plate (the side of filter paper)
            9)  Allow 15-21 days (depending on temperature of lab) for colonization of filter paper
            I 0) Inside laminar hood, remove filter paper with sterilized tweezers and place in empty Petri dish or other object to allow overnight drying to occur in hood (leave blower on)
            11) Once dry, place filter paper into a sterilized coin envelope and store long-term in -20°C refrigerator

            Glycerol Stocks of Isolates for -80°C storage
            l) Make 20% glycerol solution (40mL glycerol/ I 60m L distilled water) in glass jar
            2) Autoclave for 30 minutes on liquid cycle. Make sure caps are very loose on bottles. Let exhaust in laminar hood.
            3) Allow isolate to colonize a quarter-strength potato dextrose agar plate
            4)	In laminar hood, pour 20% glycerol solution onto plate (enough to cover surface)
            5)	Use sterile wooden coffee stirrer or glass rods to scrape top of plate to remove mycelium (small pieces of agar may be removed with no effect)
            6)	Pipet scraped solution and dispense into a cryotubc for -S0°C long-tem1storage

            Liquid Cultures of Isolates (Recover cultures) (1 only use glycerol stocks of samples with liquid cultures, when Iwouldn 't be able to recover the cultures from inoculated agar pieces or inoculated filter paper)
            I)	Make 2 liters of quarter-strength potato dextrose (no agar) and pour into 20-30 flasks (250mL). (Depending on how many flasks needed, the number of liters can be changed)
            a.	Quarter-strength potato dextrose medium:
            i.	1 Liter of DiH20
            ii.	6 grams potato dextrose broth (we use Difeo Potato Dextrose Broth from Fisher)
            2)	Pour 75 to lOOmL into each 250mL flask.
            3)	Cover each top of flask with foam plug and two pieces of aluminum foil.
            4)	Autoclave for 55 minutes and let cool until it can be touched .
            5)	Make sure you label flask with isolate name.
            6) Remove aluminum foil and plug in laminar flow hood with sterile tweezers.
            7) Use pipet and extract 30uL of fungal glycerol sample.
            8)	Remove 30uL of well-mixed solution and dispense into corresponding flask.
            9)	Cover again with foam plug and aluminum.
            JO) Place all flasks on shaker and leave at l OOrpm (these flasks can be grown without a shaker, but it will take J 5 days or more as compared to 7-10 days on shaker. (Can be longer, depending on temperature of
            lab).

            Inoculum processes

            Growing the plants
            1)  Choose a disease-susceptible soybean variety to plant in the greenhouse. Use big or small pots, as
            desired. Make four evenly spaced holes in the soil of each pot and deposit 2-3 seeds in each hole.
            2)	In 8 to l O days, plants need be thinned out to yield 4 plants per pot. Plants should then be fertilized with Osmocote.
            3)	Within 2 weeks of planti ng, plants need be staked with 12"wooden skewers to keep them from
            becoming entangled.
            Growing the pathogen and inoculum preparation
            4)	Cerco5pora sojina (or other relevant pathogen s) must be cultured on the same day the plants are planted (step 1). Four plates are usually sufficient to make enough conidial suspension to inoculate 12 soybeans at the V4 growth stay, but you should culture 6 plates just in case of culture contamination or lack of sporulation. Culture the isolate(s) on fresh Y8 media. Wrap in parafilm and incubate in complete darkness at 24°C for about 3 weeks to allow for conidia production.
            5)	After 3 weeks, harvest conidia by flooding the plates with approxi mately 15 ml of a 0.05% Tween 80 solution per plate.
            a.	Protocol for preparing the Tween 80 stock solution:  In a 1 L beaker. mix 500 mL of sterile
            deionized water and 1.5 m L of Tween 80. Stir on a magnetic stirrer until the Tween 80 is completely dissolved . It may take some time, but the Tween 80 will go into solution. This stock solution (0.3%) may be stored for some time in the flammables cabinet. Check the stock solution before each use.  If it is cloudy or shows signs of preci pitation, make a new solution before use.
            b.	To prepare  the 0.05% Tween  80 solut ion: Use the formula C1V 1= C2V2 to make 500 ml of the
            0.05% Tween 80 from the 0.3% stock Tween 80 solution (see Sa). This is achieved by taking 83 ml of 0.3% Tween 80 and combini ng with 417ml of sterile deionized water.
            6)  The surface of each fungal colony should be scraped using a sterile wooden coffee stirrer, or other
            similar device, and then the suspension needs to be filtered through four layers of sterile cheesecloth .
            7)	The concentration of conidia i n the filtrate should be measured using a hemocytometer and 1Ou! of the suspension. Adjust to the requi red concentrations by  further diluting it with 0.05% Tween 80 solution. We typically use a final concentration of I x I 05 spores/ml to inoculate the plants in the greenhouse.
            a.	Directions   for hemocytometer   usage : Determining the concentration  of spores  in suspension using a hemocytom eter requires that you count spores in certain squares based  on your total counts, dilution  factor. initial  volume, and desired  final  density. The central  square of the hemocytometer  (encircled  in red) has grids of d i fferent sizes. Take care that that you  know the grid size and height  (read  the instruction  manual), otherwise you'll  make  calculation  errors.   Use the central square (reference the bottom  left image), which  is divided  into 25 smaller squares, such that the squares highlighted  in blue are additionally  subdivided into  16 smaller squares (see middle image below)  and these blue squares are the ones within which you will  count the individual  cells; however  the size of your spores and  the density of your suspension  will
            influence which square-size wi thi n which you will need to counL For example, if your spores are
            small and high in concentration count within the smallest or 'red' squares (as displayed in part 7b); otherwise count within the 'yellow' or 'blue' squares. Do not count cells on the top and right lines (sec bottom right image).

            <!-- Insert first graph here. Will need to rescan image. -->

            b. The volume of a small square is specific to the hemocytometer. It is calculated by multiplying the width by the length (which are the same - usually  1mm each) by the depth (usually O.lmm) of a small square.

            <!-- Insert second graph and key here. -->

            c. Take the average of cells per square [sum of all cells in each small square you have counted (either blue, yellow, or red as indicated above depending on your spore size and concentration ), divided by the total number of squares you have counted], multiply it by the dilution factor (if you haven't diluted your sample, multiply by I ) and divide by the volume (in mL) of the squares you counted, as indicated in the equation below:

            <!-- Equation for measured cell density -->

            d. With the measured cell density obtained, then you can calculate how much more diluent you need in order to reach the final desired cell density. Plug the desired density, the desired final volume, and the measured cell density in the equation below and solve for the volume of the initial cell suspension required to create the appropriate dilution.

            <!-- Equation 7d -->

            e. You will need to subtract the volume you solved for in part 7d  from the final volume in order to create the dilution. 

            <!-- Equation 7e -->

            8)	For soybean plants at growth stage V4, a total volume of 2.5 ml of inoculum suspension is enough to inoculate a single plant.

            9)	Directly following inoculation, plants must be incubated in a dew chamber at 24°C for 24 hours. After that the plants should be moved to a plastic chamber to maintain high relative humidity until symptoms appear.

            10) Check the plants for symptoms daily 5 days post-inoculation. Timing may vary depending on isolates used and ambient conditions.

            <h5>Protocol for preservation of isolates: Filter paper</h5>
            1.  Cut a Whatman #I filter paper into small triangle pieces and put them ina small glass beaker for autoclaving.
            2.	In a second glass beaker, put in small coin envelopes.
            3.	Autoclave both containers at 121°C (15 psi) for at least 20 minutes.
            4.	Prepare media of choice in the typical manner. For Cercospora sojina we recommend full-strength PDA.
            5.	If preserving new isolates, monoconidial cultures are required (See single spore isolation protocol). These cultures should be 2-3 weeks old prior to attempting the preservation protocol.
            6.	Do this under a laminar flow hood. Use sterile forceps to deposit the previously sterilized filter paper directly onto your agar of choice. Ifyour agar was poured into large petri plates, you can place about 3-4 filter paper triangles (depending on the size of your filter paper) on the agar. Do not overlap the filter papers. Ifusing small petri dishes, use 1-2 filter papers.
            7.	From the mycelial culture you wish to preserve, take a plug or cut out a small piece of mycelium and deposit onto the center of the agar plate containing the filter paper(s). The fungal fragment does not need to be directly upon the filter paper. Seal plate with parafilm or place in a crisper box under lab conditions.
            8.	Repeat step 7 for all isolates as many times as desired.
            9.	Allow the cultures to colonize the filter paper (3-4 weeks). Then, under the laminar flow hood, lift the paper from the agar using sterile forceps and place in the previously sterilized coin envelopes. Filter papers from the same plate can be placed in the same envelope. Different isolates deserve different envelopes. Make sure to label envelopes appropriately (sample origin, date of isolation, date stored). Leave the filter papers in the coin envelopes in the hood to dry overnight.
            10.	Place the coin envelopes in a closed plastic container lined with silica gel sorbent, and stored at -20°C until required.
            11.	To grow out the filter paper specimen, cut small pieces of the paper using sterile forceps (under laminar flow hood) by holding the base of the paper inside the envelope and pulling the opposite site with the forceps. Plate the small filter piece(s) covered with fungal mycelium ina fresh PDA medium.
            12.	Place the plates in a crisper box (or wrap in parafilm) and incubate under lab conditions.
            13.	To increase conidia production, transfer the culture to V8 plates and incubate in complete darkness at 24-25°C. Ifsporulation is not of interest, plates can be left on the benchtop under typical lab conditions.

            <h5>Preparing the spore suspension for the conldlal germination assay</h5>
            A)	If using leaf samples:
            1.	Place leaf sample with the underside facing up under a dissectingscope
            2.	Use a 10 or 20 ul pipette to deposit a small volume (10-20ul) of sterile deionized water onto a single FLS lesion.While viewingthe lesion under the microscope,pipette the water droplet up and down to dislodge the conidia. The small silvery spores can be seen floating In the water drop once they have been dislodged.
            3.	After all of the conidia on one lesion have been dislodged,use the same pipettetip to suction up that spore suspension and transfer itto another FLS lesion and repeat the process of dislodgingthe spores.
            4.	Once satisfied that a water droplet has been saturated with spores,deposit the droplet onto the underside lid of one of the petri dishes you will be using.Pool all of your spore suspensions from one sample inthe same location.
            5.	Repeat the process as often as needed. Use a total of 50-60ul of water to generate the spore suspension.Obtain conldla from multiple lesions on at least 5 different leaves, if possible. The specific number will vary depending on the level of sporulatlon on the FLS lesions,as well and the severity of infection.
            6.	After all of the spore suspensions have been pooled onto the underside of the lid,gently pipette the droplet up and down to better distribute the spores In the suspension. Then take 25-30ul of the pooled suspension and deposit onto the middle of an unamended petri dish. Take the remaining 25 30ul and deposit onto the fungicide-amended petri dish.
            7.	Use a sterile glass rod to gently swirlthe suspensions onto the media,first the unamended plate then the amended plate.
            8.	Label the plates with the date,time,number of leaves used,and the sample name.
            9.	Leave assays in a dark place or wrap infoil for 14-18 hours and then evaluate for spore germination using a compound light microscope. Record the number of germinated and non-germinated spores on each plate.Count 100 spores on each plate whenever possible. Record the date and time of assessment.
            B)	If usingfungal mycelium:
            1.	Flood the C.so}lna culturewith 3-Sml of sterile deionized water.
            2.	Use a sterile L-shaped plastic or glass rod to crush the mycelium in the water and dislodge the spores.
            3.	Filter the spore suspension through a few layers of cheesecloth to remove mycelial fragments from the suspension.
            4.	Deposit about 30ul of the conidial spore suspension onto unamended and fungicide­
            amended plates.
            s. Use a sterile glass rod to gently swirlthe suspensions onto the media, first the
            unamended plate then the amended plate.
            6. Label the plates with the date,time,and the sample name.
            7.	Leave assays In darkness or wrap In foil for 14-18 hours and then evaluate for spore germination using a compound light microscope. Record the number of germinated and non-germinated spores on each plate. Count 100 spores on each plate whenever possible. Also record the date and time of assessment.

            <h5>Characterization of azoxystrobin sensitivity using media-coated glass slides</h5>

            Stock solutions.First, it is necessary to make stock solutions of both azoxystrobin and SHAM. To make a concentration of 100 mg/ml (100,000 µg/ml), weigh out 0.104 g of technical grade azoxystrobin (96% a.i) and dilute in 1 ml of acetone.

            Using the formula CIVI = C2V2, make 10-fold dilutions by taking 100 µI of the first concentration and mixing in 900 µI of acetone (10 mg/ml). In total, make S stock solutions: 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 µg/ml.

            For SHAM, make only one stock solution of 60 mg/ml by weighting 0.06 g of SHAM and diluting in 1mlof methanol. Vortex vigorously until completely dissolved. Place in 55°C water bath for a few minutes if having trouble dissolving.

            In both cases, the final concentration of both solvents: acetone and methanol in the media should be 0.1% (voYvol). Therefore, diluting 60 µl of each stock solution in 60 mlof media, the final concentration of the solvents will be 0.1%.

            Note: Both SHAM and Azoxystrobin are light-sensitive so keep out of light as much as possible. Wrap stocks inaluminum foil.

            Fungicide sensitivity. The media-coated glass slides use microscopic slides covered with fuIJ­
            strength PDA. For each isolate-fungicide concentration, three replicate slides should be used.

            1.	Weight 2.34 g of PDA (Becton Dickinson: BD) and fill with 60 ml of water, using small Erlenmeyer beaker (± 200 ml of capacity), for each fungicide concentration. In total use 6 fungicide concentrations (included unamended fungicide).
            2.	Autoclave at 121°C (1S psi) for 15 to 20 minutes.
            3.	Cool media using water bath until 50-SS°C.
            4.	In a laminar flow hood, add 60 µl of each fungicide concentration plus 60 µl of SHAM solution per each media. The stock solutions and the final fungicide concentrations obtained are:

            <!-- Turn this into a table. -->
            Fungicide stock solution luwmn		Final fungicide concentration  (pe/ml)

            *This is the concentration we typically usefor the conidial germination assays;however, the concentration highlighted in orange (0.1 uglml) is the discriminatory dose according
            to Carl Bradley.

            5.	Place each media amended with fungicide inindividual petri dishes

            <h5>Protocol for 2013 field sampling to characterize natural Cryptococcus f/avescens  populations</h5>

            Wheat head samples from each state are requested:
            N = 16 samples x 2 stages = 32 samples per state
            <li>16 samples = 4 samples per field (at least 40 ft apart) x 4 fjelds (at least 1mile apart)
            <li>2 stages = Early (during anthesis) + Late (1week before harvest)
            
            Each state will get the following items in one shipment:
            <li>9 UPS boxes (8 boxes serve 4 fields at 2 stages, + 1extra)
            <li>8 UPS shipping labels, one label per box, no extra (contact Xiaoqing Rong (see below) if
            one or more labels are lost, we will try to replace)
            <li>32 pre-labeled bags for 32 samples (16 samples x 2 stages) plus 8 extra unlabeled bags, in 10 stacks x 4 bags/stack (stacked by field and stage)
            <li>2 copies of this protocol and 8 copies of datasheet (1copy for 4 samples per field per stage) (photocopy backup can be made if desired)
            
            Instruction for sample collection in each field at each stage:
            <li>4 wheat head samples per field are needed; each sample has to be at least 40 ft apart from the other samples in the same field
            \	<li>	Look at the datasheets and find information on labeling - how sample names relate to field and wheat growth stage. Key: 1st and 2nd digits (letters) -State, 3rd digit (number) ­ Field identifier, 4th digit (letter) - growth stage, 5th digit (number) - sample identifier.
            Example: Hl1E3 is for Hawaii field 1,Early stage (during anthesis), sample No. 3 from this field.
            <li>Make sure each sample is correctly put into its corresponding pre-labeled bag (a bag of "'30-50 g wheat heads as one sample). Seal the bag properly and put into covered cooler.
            <li>Fill out "Field location" (GPS coordinates preferred or major landmark) and "Date of Collection" in the datasheets. Only the information for the respective 4 samples is needed.
            <li>Put the 4 sample bags from one field and the filled-out datasheet into one UPS box, attach one shipping label and ship to OARDC in Wooster by UPS overnight within 24 hrs of sampling.
